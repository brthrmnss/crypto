</P>
<P>It is nine minutes before sunrise in the great
city of Ulan Bator, capital of the reconstituted world. For some time
now Dr. Shadrach Mordecai has lain awake, restless and tense in his
hammock, staring somberly at aglowing green circlet in the wall that
is the shining face of his data screen. Red letters on the screen
announce the new day:</P>
<H5><BR><BR>
</H5>
<H5>MONDAY</H5>
<H5>14 May</H5>
<H5>2012</H5>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>As usual, Dr. Mordecai has been unable to get more
than a few hours of sleep. Insomnia has plagued him all year; his
wakefulness must be some kind of message from his cerebral cortex,
but so far he has been unable to decipher it. Today, at least, he has
some excuse for awakening early, because great challenges and
tensions lie ahead. Dr. Mordecai is personal physician to Genghis II
Mao IV Khan, Prince of Princes and Chairman of Chairmen&mdash;which
is to say, ruler of the earth &mdash;and on this day the aged Genghis
Mao is due to undergo a liver transplant, his third in seven years.</P>
<P>The world leader sleeps less than twenty meters
away, in a suite adjoining Mordecai's. Dictator and doctor occupy
residential chambers on the seventy-fifth floor of the Grand Tower of
the Khan, a superb onyx-walled needle of a building that rises
breathtakingly from the dusty brown Mongolian tableland. Just now
Genghis Mao sleeps soundly, eyes unmoving beneath the thick lids,
spine enviably relaxed, respiration slow and even, pulse steady,
hormone levels rising normally. Mordecai knows all this because he
carries, surgically inlaid in the flesh of his arms, thighs, and
buttocks, several dozen minute perceptor nodes that constantly
provide him with telemetered information on the stale of Genghis
Mao's vital signs. It took Mordecai a year of full-time training to
learn to read the input, the tiny twitches and tremors and flickers
and itches that are the analogue-coded equivalents of the Chairman's
major bodily processes, but by this time it is second nature for him
to perceive and comprehend the data. A tickle here means digestive
distress, a throb there means urinary sluggishness, a pricking
elsewhere tells of saline imbalance. For Shadrach Mordecai it is
something like living in two bodies at once, but he has grown
accustomed to it. And so the Chairman's precious life is safeguarded
by his vigilant physician. Genghis Mao is officially said to be
eighty-seven years old and may be even older, though his body, a
patchwork of artificial and transplanted organs, is as strong and
responsive as that of a man of fifty. It is the Chairman's wish to
postpone death until his work on earth is complete&mdash;which is to
say, never to die.</P>
<P>How sweetly he rests now! Mordecai runs
automatically through the readings again and again: respiratory,
digestive, endocrine, circulatory, all the autonomic systems going
beautifully. The Chairman, dreamless (the motionless eyes), lying as
customary on his left side (faint aortal pressure), emitting gentle
hhnnorrking snores (reverberations in the rib cage), obviously feels
no apprehension about the coming surgery. Mordecai envies him his
calmness. Of course, organ transplants are an old story to Genghis
Mao.</P>
<P>At the precise moment of dawn the doctor leaves
his hammock, stretches, walks naked across his bedchamber's cool
stone floor to the balcony, and steps outside. The air, suffused now
with early blue to the east, is clear, crisp, cold, with a sharp wind
blowing across the plains, a strong southerly breeze racing through
Mongolia from the Great Wall toward Lake Baikal. It ruffles the black
flags of Genghis Mao in Sukhe Baior Square, the capital's grand
plaza, and stirs the boughs of the pink-blossomed tamarisks. Shadrach
Mordecai inhales deeply and studies the remote horizon, as if looking
for meaningful smoke signals out of China. No signals come; only the
little throbs and tingles of the implant disks, caroling the song of
Genghis Mao's irrepressible good health.</P>
<P>All is quiet below. The whole city sleeps, save
for those who must be awake to work; Mongols are not given to
insomnia. Mordecai is; but then, Mordecai isn't a Mongol. He is a
black man, dark with an African darkness, though he is no African
either; slender, long-limbed, tall&mdash;some two hundred centimeters
in height&mdash;with dense woolly hair, large wide-set eyes, full
lips, a broad though high-bridged nose. In this land of sturdy
golden-skinned folk with sharp noses and glossy straight hair. Dr.
Mordecai is a conspicuous figure, more conspicuous, perhaps, than he
would like to be.</P>
<P>He squats, straightens, squats, straightens,
jackknifing his arms out and in, out and in. He starts every morning
with a calisthenic routine on the balcony, naked in the chilly air:
he is thirty-six years old, and even though his post in the
government gives him guaranteed access to the Roncevic Antidote, even
though he is thus spared the fear of organ-rot that obsesses most of
the world's two billion inhabitants, thirty-six is nevertheless an
age when one must begin conscientiously to take measures to protect
the body against the normal unravelings time brings. <I>Metis sana in
corpore sano; </I>yes, keep on bending and twisting, Shadrach; make
the juices flow; let the old yin balance the yang. He is in perfect
health, and his bodily organs are the ones that were in him when he
popped from the womb one frosty day in 1976. Up, down, up, down,
unsparing of self. Sometimes it seems odd to him that his vigorous,
violent morning exercises never awaken Genghis Mao, but of course the
flow of telemetered data runs only in one direction, and as Mordecai
puts himself through his fierce balcony workout, the Chairman snores
placidly on, unaware.</P>
<P>Eventually, panting, perspiring, shivering
lightly, feeling alive and open and receptive, hardly worrying at all
about the coming surgical ordeal, Mordecai decides he has had enough
of a workout. He washes, dresses, punches for his customary light
breakfast, and sets about his morning routine of duties.</P>
<P>So, then, the doctor confronts Interface Three,
through which he daily enters the residential suite of his master the
Khan. It is a ponderous diamond-shaped doorway, two and a half meters
high. From its silken-smooth bronze surface jut a dozen and a half
warty cylindrical snouts, three to nine centimeters high. Some of
them are scanners and sensors, some are audio conduits, some are
weapons of ineluctable lethality; and Shadrach Mordecai has no idea
which is which. Most likely, what serves as a scanner today may well
be a laser cannon tomorrow; with such random shifts of function does
Genghis Mao contrive to confuse the faceless assassins he so vividly
dreads. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Shadrach Mordecai to serve the Khan,&quot;
Mordecai says in a clear firm voice into what he hopes is today's
audio pickup.</P>
<P>Interface Three, now emitting a gentle hum,
subjects Mordecai's announcement to voiceprint analysis. At the same
time, Mordecai's body is being checked for thermal output, mass,
postural stress, olfactory texture, and much more. If any datum
should fall beyond the established Mordecai-norm, he could find
himself immobilized by loops of suddenly spurting webfoam while the
guards are summoned to investigate; resistance at that point might
lead to his immediate destruction. Five of these interfaces protect
the five entrances to Chairman Genghis Mao's chambers, and they are
the wiliest doors ever devised. Daedalus himself could not have
forged more clever barriers to guard King Minos.</P>
<P>In a microsecond Mordecai is recognized to be
himself, rather than some cunning lifelike simulacrum on a
king-slaying errand. With a smooth hiss of perfectly machined joints
and a gentle nimble of flawless bearings the interface's outer slab
glides open. This admits the doctor to a stone-walled inner holding
chamber hardly larger than himself. No welcome vestibule for
claustrophobes, this. Here he must halt another microsecond while the
entire surveillance is repeated, and only after he passes this second
muster is he allowed to enter the imperial residence proper. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Redundancy,&quot; Chairman Genghis Mao has
declared, &quot;is our main avenue of survival.&quot; Mordecai
agrees. The intricate business of crossing these interfaces is a
trifle to him, part of the normal order of the universe, no more
bothersome than the need to turn a key in a lock. The room just on
the far side of Interface Three is a cavernous sphere known as
Surveillance Vector One. It is, in a literal sense, Genghis Mao's
window on the world. Here a dazzling array of screens, each five
square meters in area, rises in overwhelming tiers from floor to
ceiling, offering a constantly shifting panorama of televised images
relayed from thousands of spy-eyes everywhere on the planet. No great
public building is without its secret eyes; scanners look down on all
major streets; a corps of government engineers is constantly employed
in shifting the cameras from place to place and in installing new
ones in previously unspied-upon places. Nor are all the eyes in fixed
positions. So many spy-satellites streak through the nearer reaches
of space that if their orbits were turned to silk they would swathe
the earth in a dense cocoon. At the center of Surveillance Vector One
is a grand control panel by means of which the Khan, sitting for
hours at a time in an elegant thronelike seat, is able to control the
flow of data from all these eyes, calling in signals with quick
flutters of his fingertips so that he may look at will into the
doings of Tokyo and Bangkok, New York and Moscow, Buenos Aires and
Cairo. So sharp is the resolution of the Khan's myriad lenses that
they can show Genghis Mao the color of a man's eyes at a distance of
five kilometers.</P>
<P>When the Chairman is not making use of
Surveillance Vector One, the hundreds of screens continue to function
without interruption as the master mechanism sucks in data randomly
from the innumerable pickup points. Images come and go, sometimes
flitting across a screen in a second or two, sometimes lingering to
provide consecutive sequences many minutes in length. Shadrach
Mordecai, since he must pass through this room every morning on his
way to his master, has formed the habit of pausing for a few minutes
to watch the gaudy, dizzying stream of pictures. Privately he refers
to this daily interlude as &quot;Checking the Trauma Ward,&quot; the
Trauma Ward being Mordecai's secret name for the world in general,
that great vale of sorrow and bodily corruption.</P>
<P>He stands in mid-room now, observing the world's
griefs.</P>
<P>The flow is jerkier than usual today; whatever
giant computer operates this system is in a twitchy mood, it seems,
its commands moving restlessly from eye to eye, and pictures wink on
and off in a frenzied way. Still, there are isolated flashes of
clarity. A limping woebegone dog moves slowly down a dirt-choked
street. A big-eyed, big-bellied Negroid child stands naked in a
dust-swept ravine, gnawing her thumb and crying. A sag-shouldered old
woman, carrying carefully wrapped bundles through the cobbled plaza
of some mellow European city, gasps and clutches at her chest,
letting her packages tumble as she falls. A parched Oriental-faced
man with wispy white beard and tiny green skullcap emerges from a
shop, coughs, and spits blood. A crowd&mdash;Mexicans?
Japanese?&mdash;gathers around two boys dueling with carving knives;
their arms and chests are bright with red cuts. Three children huddle
on the roof of a torn-away house rushing swiftly downstream on the
white-flecked gray breast of a flooding river. A hawk-faced beggar
stretches forth an accusing clawlike hand. A young dark-haired woman
kneels at a curb, bowed double in pain, head touching the pavement,
while two small boys look on. A speeding automobile veers crazily
from a highway and vanishes in a bushy gulley. Surveillance Vector
One is like some vast tapestry of hundreds of compartments, each with
a story to tell, a fragmentary story, tantalizing, defying
comprehension. Out there in the world, out in the great big wide
Trauma Ward that is the world, the two billion subjects of Genghis II
Mao IV Khan are dying hour by hour, despite the best efforts of the
Permanent Revolutionary Committee. Nothing new about that&mdash;everyone
who has ever lived has died hour by hour all through his life&mdash;but
the modes of death are different in these years following the Virus
War; death seems ever so much more immediate when so many people are
so conspicuously rotting within all at once; and the general decay
out there is that much more poignant because there are these
innumerable eyes to see it in its totality. The scanners of the Khan
capture everything, making no comment, offering no judgment, merely
filling these walls with a staggering, baffling portrait of the
revised postwar early-twenty-first-century version of the human
condition.</P>
<P>The room is a touchstone of character, drawing
revealing responses from every viewer. To Mordecai the whirling
stream of scenes is fascinating and repelling, a crazy mosaic of
decomposition and defeat, courage and endurance; he loves and pities
the sufferers who flash so quickly across the screens, and if he
could he would embrace them all&mdash;lift that old woman to her
feet, put coins in the beggar's gnarled hand, stroke that child's
distended belly. But Mordecai is, by inclination and profession, a
healer. To others the brutal theater that is Surveillance Vector One
serves only as a reminder of their own good fortune: how wise of them
it was to attain high governmental rank and steady supplies of the
Roncevic Antidote, to enjoy the favor of Chairman Genghis Mao and
live free of pain and hunger and organ-rot, insulated from the
nightmare of real life! To others the screens are unbearable,
arousing not a sense of smug superiority but rather a feeling of
intolerable guilt that they should be here, safe, while <I>they </I>are
out there. And to others the screens are merely boring: they show
dramas without plot, transactions without discernible purpose,
tragedies without moral significance, mere stray snatches of life's
scratchy fabric. What Genghis Mao's own reactions to Surveillance
Vector One may be is impossible to determine, for the Khan is, in
this as in so many other things, wholly inscrutable as he manipulates
the controls. But he does spend hours in there. Somehow the room
feeds him. Shadrach Mordecai takes his time this morning, giving the
huge room five minutes, eight, ten. Genghis Mao still sleeps, after
all. The implanted monitors tell Mordecai that. In this world no one
escapes surveillance; while the many eyes of Genghis Mao scan the
globe, the slumbering Khan is himself scanned by his physician.
Mordecai, standing quite motionless beside the Chairman's upholstered
throne, receives a flood of data within and without, Genghis Mao's
metabolic output twanging and tweaking the doctor's implants, the
flowing shimmer of the screens assailing his eyes. He starts to
leave, but just then a screen high up and to his left shows him a
glimpse of what is certainly Philadelphia, unmistakably Philadelphia,
and he halts, riveted. His native city: he was a Bicentennial baby,
entering the world in Ben Franklin's own town, coming forth high up
in Hahnemann Hospital when the United States of America was four
months short of its two hundredth birthday. And there is Philadelphia
now, turning in the gyre of some ineffably keen satellite-mounted
eye; the familiar childhood totems, City Hall, Independence Hall,
Penn Center, Christ Church. It is years since he last was there. For
a decade now, Shadrach Mordecai has lived in Mongolia. Once it was
hard for him to believe that there really was such a place as
Mongolia, fabled land of Prester John and Genghis Khan, but by this
time it is Philadelphia that has started to seem a place of fable to
him. And the United States of America? Do those syllables still have
meaning? Who could imagine that the Constitution of Jefferson and
Madison would be forgotten, and America pledge allegiance to a Mongol
overlord? But that overstates the case: America, Mordecai knows, is
governed like all other nations by a local wing of the Permanent
Revolutionary Committee, that alliance of radical and reactionary
groups functioning through a series of vestigial quasi-democratic
institutions; and the aged recluse Genghis Mao is merely the Chairman
of the Committee, a remote and semimythical figure who governs
indirectly and has no immediate consequence in the daily lives of Dr.
Mordecai's former countrymen. Probably no one in America pauses to
consider Genghis Mao the embodiment of the authority of the Permanent
Revolutionary Committee, and thus the true master of the body
politic, any more than one considers the chairman of the board of the
local electric company to be the source and controller of the power
that flows when the switch is thrown. But he is. Not that many
Americans would be disturbed to learn that they owed fealty to a
Mongol. The whole world has abdicated; the game of politics is ended;
Genghis Mao rules by default, rules because <I>no one cares, </I>because
in an exhausted, shattered world dying of organ-rot, there is general
relief that someone, anyone, is willing to play the role of global
dictator.</P>
<P>Philadelphia vanishes from the screen and is
replaced by an idyllic tropical scene, pink-white half-moon beach,
feathery palm fronds, flowering hibiscus in scarlet and yellow, no
people in view. Mordecai shrugs and moves on.</P>
<P>The imperial chambers are circular in layout,
occupying the entire top story of the Grand Tower of the Khan except
for the five wedge-shaped apartments, such as the one where Mordecai
lives, that notch into the suite equidistantly around its rim. As the
doctor crosses Surveillance Vector One he comes to three massive
doorways, spaced some eight meters apart along the side of the room
farthest from the interface through which he entered. The left-hand
doorway leads to the bedroom of Genghis Mao, but Mordecai does not
take it&mdash;best to let the Chairman have all the sleep he needs,
today&mdash;nor does he choose the central doorway, which goes to the
Chairman's private office. Instead he approaches the right-hand
doorway, the one that opens into the room known as Committee Vector
One, through which he must pass to reach his own office.</P>
<P>He waits briefly while the door scans and approves
him. All the inner rooms of the imperial suite are divided one from
another by such impermeable barriers, smaller in scope than the main
doors at the five interfaces but similarly suspicious: no one is
allowed to range freely here from room to room. After a moment the
door grants him entry to Committee Vector One. This is a large,
brightly lit room, spherical like all the major rooms of Genghis
Mao's suite. It occupies the physical center of the apartment, the
locus around which all else turns, and in a less literal sense it is
the nerve center of the planetary governing structure, the Permanent
Revolutionary Committee. Here, day and night, arrive urgent
communiques from Committee cadres in every city; and here, day and
night. Committee potentates sit in front of intricate switchboards
glistening with terminals, making policy and communicating it to the
lesser satraps in the outer provinces. All applications for Roncevic
Antidote treatments are routed through this room; all requests for
organ transplants, regeneration therapy, and other vital medical
services are considered in Committee Vector One; all jurisdictional
disputes within the regional Committee leadership are settled here
according to the principles of centripetal depolarization, Genghis
Mao's chief philosophical gift to humanity. Shadrach Mordecai is not
a political man and he has little concern with the events that take
place in Committee Vector One, but since the floor plan of the
building requires him to cross the room many times a day, he does
occasionally pause to observe the bureaucrats at their labors, the
way he might stop to examine the behavior of bizarre insects in a
crumbling log.</P>
<P>Not much seems to be going on here now. At times
of high crisis all twelve of the switchboard seats are occupied, and
Genghis Mao himself, seated at his own elaborate desk at the very
center of everything, fiercely manipulating his formidable battery of
sophisticated communications devices, directs the course of strategy.
But these are quiet days. The only conspicuous crisis in the world is
the one in the Chairman's liver, and that will soon be remedied. For
weeks now Genghis Mao has not bothered to take up his post in
Committee Vector One, preferring to discharge his sovereign
responsibilities from his smaller private office adjoining his
bedroom. And only three of the switch-boards are in use this morning,
operated by weary-looking vice-chairmen, one male and two female, who
yawn and slouch as they take incoming messages and formulate
appropriate replies.</P>
<P>Mordecai is halfway across the room and walking
briskly when someone calls his name. He turns and sees Mangu, the
heir-apparent to Genghis Mao, heading toward him from the direction
of the Chairman's private office.</P>
<P>&quot;Do they operate on the Khan today?&quot;
Mangu asks worriedly.</P>
<P>Mordecai says, nodding, &quot;In about three
hours.&quot;</P>
<P>Mangu frowns. He is a sleek, handsome young
Mongol, unusually tall for his kind, nearly as tall as Mordecai
himself.</P>
<P>His face is round; his features are symmetrical
and pleasing; his eyes are bright and alert. At the moment he seems
tense, jangled,</P>
<P>&quot;Will it go well, Shadrach? Are there any
risks?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Don't worry. You won't become Khan today.
It's only a liver transplant, after all.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;<I>Only!&quot;</I></P>
<P>&quot;Genghis Mao's had plenty of those.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;But how much more surgery can he stand?
Genghis Mao is an old man.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Better not let him hear you say that!&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;He's probably listening right this minute,&quot;
says Mangu casually. Some of the tension goes from him. He grins.
&quot;The Khan never takes what I say seriously, anyway. I believe he
sometimes thinks I'm a bit of a fool.&quot;</P>
<P>Mordecai smiles guardedly. He also sometimes
thinks Mangu is a bit of a fool, and perhaps more than a bit. He
remembers Dr. Crowfoot of Project Avatar, Nikki Crowfoot, <I>his
</I>Nikki with whom he would have spent this past night but for
Genghis Mao's operation, telling him months ago of the dismal fate
reserved for Mangu. Mordecai knows, as Mangu almost certainly does
not, that Genghis Mao plans to be his own successor, through the
vehicle of Mangu's strong, healthy young body. If Project Avatar is
carried to a successful conclusion, and the auguries are favorable
for it, the fine sturdy figure of Mangu will indeed someday sit upon
the throne of Genghis Mao, but Mangu himself won't be there to enjoy
the occasion. To Mordecai, anyone who marches as blithely toward his
own destruction as Mangu is doing, perceiving nothing, suspecting
nothing, fearing nothing, is a fool and worse than a fool.</P>
<P>&quot;Where will you be during the operation?&quot;
Mordecai asks. 
</P>
<P>Mangu gestures broadly toward the main command
desk of Committee Vector One. &quot;Over there, pretending to run the
show.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Pretending?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You know there are many things I still have
to learn, Shadrach. I'm not going to be ready to take over for <I>years.
</I>That's why I wish he wouldn't undergo all these transplants.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;He doesn't do it for the exercise,&quot;
Mordecai says. &quot;The present liver's been failing for weeks. It's
got to come out. But I tell you: don't worry.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Mangu smiles and grips Mordecai's forearm for a
brief, affectionate, surprisingly painful squeeze. &quot;I won't. I
have faith in you, Shadrach. In the whole medical team that keeps the
Khan alive. Let me know the moment it's over, will you?&quot;</P>
<P>He strides away, toward the main command post, to
play at being monarch of the world.</P>
<P>Mordecai shakes his head. Mangu is an attractive
figure, genial and charming and even charismatic. In a dark time lit
only by ghastly jagged flashes of nightmare-light, Mangu is something
of a popular hero. In the past ten months or so he has become the
Chairman's public surrogate, appearing in Genghis Mao's place at
formal functions, dam dedications, Committee congresses and the like,
and the dashing, gallant prince-in-waiting, so disarming, so
unpretentious, so accessible to the populace, is beloved in a way
that Genghis Mao never has been, never for an instant. Those who have
observed Mangu at close range are aware that he is essentially a
hollow man, all image and no substance, shallow and plump-souled, an
amiable athlete living an implausible charade; but though Mangu is
trivial, he is far from contemptible, and Mordecai feels genuine
compassion for him. Poor Mangu, fretting over the possibility that he
might succeed the Khan this day, with his apprenticeship not yet
finished! Does it ever occur to Mangu that he will <I>never</I>&mdash;not
in a year, not in ten years, not in a thousands&mdash;be a fit
successor to Genghis Mao, that he is fundamentally incapable of
wielding the terrible power which he is ostensibly being groomed to
inherit? Apparently not. Or else Mangu, knowing his own limits, would
gave begun to wonder what plan Genghis Mao really had for him, why
the Chairman had picked as his successor a mere handsome boy, his own
opposite in all important respects. To train him to be supreme
sovereign? No. No. To be a puppet, merely; to dance before the people
and win their love. And then, one day, to have his identity scooped
out and thrown away, so that his body might become a dwelling for the
wily mind and dark soul of Genghis Mao, when the Chairman's own
ancient patched hull can no longer be repaired. Poor Mangu. Mordecai
shivers. He hurries on into his own office, closes the door, seals
it.</P>
<P>There is a sudden sharp twanging in his left
thigh, close to the hip, the place where he receives Genghis Mao's
cerebral output. Four rooms away, the Khan is awakening.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3>2</H3>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Mordecai's office is an island of tranquility for
him within the tumultuous intensity of life atop the Grand Tower of
the Khan. The room, a sphere ten meters in diameter, has many
entrances, but they are programmed to open only for himself or
Genghis Mao. One is the door through which he has just come, out of
Committee Vector One. Another goes to the Khan's private dining room,
and another, on the far side, to a seldom-used heavy-insulation study
known as the Khan's Retreat. The last door is Interface Five,
connecting the doctor's office to the two-story-high Surgery that
occupies one of the five outer wedges of the tower.</P>
<P>In the sanctuary of his office Shadrach Mordecai
enjoys a few moments of peace before proceeding on his voyage into
the turmoils of the day. Though Genghis Mao is up, there is no need
to hurry. Mordecai's implants tell him&mdash;by now, he can equate
every trifling inner signal with some concrete aspect of the Khan's
activities&mdash;that the imperial servitors have entered Genghis
Mao's bedchamber, have helped the Khan to his feet, are walking him
through the series of mild arm-swinging chest-stretching exercises
that the old man, at Dr. Mordecai's insistence, performs every
morning. Next they will bathe him, then they will shave him, finally
they will dress him and bring him forth. Though there will be no
breakfast for Genghis Mao today, because of the impending operation,
Shadrach Mordecai has at  least an hour before he must attend the
Khan.</P>
<P>Simply being in the office buoys him. The dark,
rich paneling,  the subdued lighting, the curving uncluttered desk of
strange  exotic woods, the splendid bookcase of crystalline rods and
thin travertine slabs in which he keeps his priceless library of
classic medical texts, the elegant armoires that house his extensive
collection of antique medical instruments&mdash;it is an ideal
environment for him, a perfect enclosure for the doctor he would like
to be and occasionally is able to believe he is, the master of the
Hippocratic arts, the prince of healers, the preserver and prolonger
of life. Not that this room is a place for the practice of medicine.
The only medical tools here are ancient ones, romantic and quaint
apparatus, odd beakers and scalpels and lancets, bloodletting knives
and cauterizing irons, ophthalmoscopes and defibrillators, early and
inaccurate anatomical models, chirurgical saws, sphygmomanometers,
electrical invigorators, flasks of discredited antitoxins, trephines,
microtomes, relics of more innocent times. He has acquired these
things eagerly in the past five years, by way of establishing his
professional kinship with the great physicians of yesterday. The
books, too, rare and auspicious, landmarks of medical history,
talismans of scientific progress: the <I>Fabrica </I>of Vesalius, <I>De
Motu Cordis </I>of Harvey, Boerhaave's <I>Institutiones, </I>Laennec
on auscultation, Beaumont on digestion&mdash;with what joy be has
collected them, with what reverence he has fondled them! Not without
some guilt, too, for in this battered and deflated era it is all too
easy for those few who have power and wealth to take advantage of
those who have not; and Mordecai, so close to the throne, has
accumulated his treasures cheaply, catching them as they slip from
the grasp of older, unluckier, perhaps more worthy possessors. Still,
had these things not descended to him they might have been lost
altogether in the chaos that surges freely through the world beyond
the Grand Tower of the Khan.</P>
<P>Mordecai's actual medical work is done elsewhere,
in the Surgery beyond Interface Five, which serves not only for
actual surgical operations but also for any other medical attention
Genghis Mao may need. Mordecai's office is a place for research and
reflection only. Just to the right of his desk are keyboards, compact
data terminals, giving him instant access to entire libraries of
medical knowledge; he need only touch a finger to a key or even speak
a coded word, cite symptomata, facies, tentative diagnosis, and back
will come, in neatly codified form, extracts from the accumulated
scientific wisdom of the eons, the relevant distillate of everything
from the Smith Papyrus and Hippocrates and Galen down through the
latest findings of the microbiologists and immunologists and
endocrinologists who labor in the laboratories of the Khan. It is all
here: encephalitis and endocarditis, gastritis and gout, nephritis,
nephrosis, neuroma, nystagmus, aspergillosis and bilharzia, uremia
and xanthochromia, the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to.
Time was when doctors were shamans in feathers and paint, bravely
pounding drums to frighten away frightening demons, doing solitary
battle against unfathomable causes and unaccountable effects, gamely
piercing veins and ventilating skulls, grubbing for roots and leaves
of purely magical merit. Alone against the dark spirits of disease,
no guide but one's stock of inherited supernatural lore and one's
intuition. And now! Here! The answer machine! A touch of the finger
and behold: etiology, pathology, symptomatology, pharmacology,
contraindications, prophylaxis, prognosis, sequelae, the whole
miraculous scroll of diagnosis and treatment and cure and
convalescence unrolling at a command! In moments of lull Shadrach
Mordecai enjoys testing his wits against the computer, setting
hypothetical problems for himself, postulating symptoms and proposing
diagnoses; he is eleven years out of Harvard Medical School and still
a student, ever a student.</P>
<P>Today allows few lulls. He swings to his left and
taps out the telephone number of the Surgery. &quot;Warhaftig,&quot;
he says crisply.</P>
<P>A moment, and there the screen shows the flat,
homely face of Nicholas Warhaftig, surgeon to the Khan, veteran of a
hundred critical transplant operations. The camera picks up a
sweeping view of the operating room behind him, boards glittering
with measuring dials and control panels, the laser bank, the
anesthesiologist's spidery maze of needles and tubes and pipes, and,
only partly visible, the main surgical stage itself, dais and bed and
lights and instruments, white linens and dazzling chrome-steel
fixtures, everything awaiting the imperial patient. 
</P>
<P>&quot;The Khan's awake,&quot; Mordecai says. 
</P>
<P>&quot;We're on schedule, than,&quot; says
Warhaftig. 
</P>
<P>He is sixty years old, silver-haired, phlegmatic.
He was already the supreme organ-transplant man when Shadrach
Mordecai was an idol-worshipping undergraduate, and though Mordecai
is technically his superior on Genghis Mao's staff now, there is no
doubt in either man's mind about which one of them actually holds the
greater professional authority. This makes their relationship an
uncomfortable one for Mordecai. 
</P>
<P>Warhaftig says, &quot;Will you get him to me by
0900 sharp?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'll try.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Try hard,&quot; Warhaftig replies dryly,
mouth quirking. &quot;We begin perfusion at 0915. The liver's still
on ice, but coordinating defrost is always tricky. How's he feeling?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;As usual. The strength of ten men.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Can you give me quick readings on blood
glucose and fibrinogen production?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;A moment,&quot; Mordecai says. Those are not
factors on which he receives direct telemetering from Genghis Mao's
body; but he has become skillful in deducing hundreds of the
Chairman's lesser body functions from clues given by the main
metabolic responses. He says shortly, &quot;Glucose doing fine,
within the expected reduced levels caused by the general hepatic
necrosis. It's harder to get the fibrinogen reading, but my feeling
is that all the plasma proteins are on the low side. Probably the
fibrinogen not as bad as the heparin.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And bile?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Off sharply since Friday. Down some more
this morning. No critical breakdowns of any function yet.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;All right,&quot; Warhaftig says. He gestures
brusquely to someone beyond camera range. The surgeon's hands are
formidable, long and muscular, fingers like elongated pliable wands,
incredible octave-devouring fingers of extraordinary power and
delicacy. Shadrach Mordecai, although he is no surgeon, has strong
and graceful hands himself, but the sight of Warhaftig's always make
him think of his own as coarse and stumpy, butcher-fingered hands.
&quot;We're moving well here. I'll expect you at 0900. Anything
else?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I just wanted you to know the Khan was
awake,&quot; Mordecai answers, a little sharply, and breaks the
contact.</P>
<P>Next he phones the Chairman's bedchamber and talks
briefly with one of the Khan's valets. Yes, Genghis Mao is awake, he
has bathed, he is readying himself for the operation. He will begin
his morning meditation in a moment. Does the doctor wish to speak
with the Khan before that? The doctor does. The screen goes blank,
and there is a lengthy pause during which Mordecai feels his
adrenalin levels beginning to rise: not yet, not even after all this
time, has the fear and awe that Genghis Mao inspires in him begun to
ebb. He forces himself into calmness with a quick centering exercise,
and none too soon, for abruptly the head and shoulders of Genghis II
Mao IV Khan appear on the telephone screen.</P>
<P>The Chairman is a lean, leathery-looking man with
a narrow triangular skull, powerful cheekbones, heavy brows, fierce
eyes, thin harsh lips. His skin is more brown than yellow in tone;
his hair is thick, black, combed back straight from his forehead and
descending almost to his shoulders. His face is one that readily and
obviously evokes dread, but also, oddly, trust; he seems
omniperceptive and omnicompetent, a man to whom all the burdens of
the world can be given and who will uncomplainingly and effectually
assume them. The recent deterioration of his current liver has had
visible effect on him&mdash;a bronzing of his skin beyond its normal
deep hue, some blotches of pigment on his cheeks, an uncharacteristic
feverish brightness of the eyes&mdash; but still he seems a man of
regal bearing and inexhaustible strength, a man designed by nature to
endure and to rule.</P>
<P>&quot;Shadrach,&quot; he says. His voice is deep,
grating, with a narrow dynamic range, not really a good demagogue's
voice. &quot;How am I this morning?&quot;</P>
<P>It is an old joke between them. The Khan laughs;
Mordecai manages a bilious smile.</P>
<P>The doctor replies, &quot;Strong, well rested, a
little low on blood sugar, but everything generally as expected.
Warhaftig is waiting for you. He'd like you in the Surgery by 0900
hours. Mangu's at the Committee Vector One desk. It's a quiet day so
far.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;This will be my fourth liver.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Your third, sir,&quot; Mordecai says gently.
&quot;I've been over the records. First transplant in 2005, the
second in 2010, and now&mdash;&ldquo;</P>
<P> &ldquo;I was born with one also, Shadrach. We
should count that. I'm human, eh, Shadrach? We mustn't forget the set
of organs I<I> </I>was born with.&quot; Genghis Mao's inescapable
eyes pierce the uneasy Mordecai. Human, yes, one must always try to
keep that in mind; the Chairman is human, though his pancreas is a
tiny plastic disk and his heart is constantly spurred by electric
jolts delivered through fine silver needles and his kidneys were
grown in bodies other than his own and his spleen his lungs his
corneas his colon his esophagus his pharynx his thymus his pulmonary
artery his stomach his yes oh yes human he is human but sometimes it
is hard to remember that&mdash;and sometimes, looking into those
irresistible terrifying glacial eyes, one sees not the godlike flash
of supreme authority, but something else, an opaque look of fatigue
or perhaps terror, a look that seems at once to reveal an
overwhelming fear of death and to offer warm welcome to it. Genghis
Mao is death-haunted, certainly, a man whose grasp on life is so
ferocious after nine decades that he will submit to any bodily
torment in order to buy another month, another year; he lives in
morbid dread of death and his eyes proclaim it; but he is
death-loving, too, obsessed with the termination that he constantly
postpones, as much so as a man who is obsessed with the orgasm he
strives so fiercely to delay. Mordecai has heard Genghis Mao speak of
<I>the purity of not-being. </I>Not for him the coming of <I>s<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">&uuml;</FONT>sser
Tod, </I>no, never, and yet how he savors the tempting sweetness of
it even as he averts his lips from it. Mordecai suspects that only
such a man, death-haunted, death-obsessed, would want to make himself
master of the sort of place this world has become. But how can
Genghis Mao, brooding dreamily on the delicate beauties of death,
nevertheless also yearn to live forever?</P>
<P>&quot;Come for me at 0900,&quot; the Chairman
tells him.</P>
<P>Mordecai nods to a dead screen.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3>3</H3>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>In the time remaining before he must go to fetch
the Khan, Shadrach Mordecai discharges one of his regular
bureaucratic responsibilities: receiving the daily progress reports
from the directors of the three great research schemes in which
Genghis Mao has much of the resources of the government mobilized,
Project Talos, Project Phoenix, and Project Avatar. As Genghis Mao's
physician, Shadrach is ex-officio head of all three projects, and he
confers each morning with the project leaders whose laboratories are
located in the lower levels of the Grand Tower of the Khan.</P>
<P STYLE="background: transparent">Katya Lindman of
Project Talos comes on screen first. &quot;We coded the eyelids
yesterday,&quot; she tells him at once. &quot;It's one of the biggest
steps so far in our analogue-to-digital conversion program. As of now
we have seven of Genghis Mao's three hundred basic kinesic traits
fully graphed and equivalented.&quot; She is a short, wide-shouldered
woman, a Swede, formidably intelligent, dark-haired and easily
angered, a woman of considerable beauty despite or perhaps because of
her thin-lipped, sharp-toothed, oddly feral and menacing mouth. Her
project is the most farfetched of the three, an attempt to develop a
mechanical Genghis Mao, an analogue-entity through which he can
continue to rule after bodily death&mdash;a puppet, a simulacrum, but
one with a sustaining Genghis Mao-like life of its own. The
technology for building such an automaton already exists, of course;
the problem is to create something that transcends the Walt Disney
robots that Mordecai remembers from his youth, the cunning Abe
Lincoln and Thomas Edison and Christopher Columbus machines, so
lifelike in their skin tones and movements and manner of speaking.
Disney machines are not sufficient to the present need. A Disneyed
Abe Lincoln can deliver the Gettysburg Address flawlessly, eight
times an hour, but it would never be able to deal with a delegation
of angry Reconstructionist congressmen; and a Genghis Mao of metal
and plastic might spout the tenets of centripetal depolarization with
hypnotic eloquence, but what value would that be in meeting the
crises of a constantly changing, challenging society? No, they must
capture the essence of the living Genghis Mao, code it, make from it
a program that will continue to grow and react. Shadrach Mordecai is
skeptical of success. He asks Katya Lindman, as he does every few
weeks, how her department is coming on the task of digitalizing
Genghis Mao's mental processes, which is rather more difficult than
working out digital programs for his facial expressions and habits of
posture. The question is threatening to her, and her eyes briefly
flash with familiar fire; but all she says is, &quot;We continue to
attack the problem. Our best people are constantly at work on it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Thank you,&quot; Shadrach says, and switches
to Irayne Sarafrazi's channel. The head of Project Phoenix is a young
Persian gerontologist, a slight, almost fragile-looking person, with
huge dark eyes, full solemn lips, black hair pulled back starkly from
her forehead. Her group seeks a body-renewal technique that will
allow rejuvenation of the living cellular matter of Genghis Mao, so
that he may be reborn in his own skin when he no longer has the
strength and resilience to accept further organ transplants. The
prime obstacle here is the unwillingness of the brain to regenerate
the cells it daily sloughs off; reversing the decline of the other
organs and making them young again is a relatively simple matter of
nucleic-acid reprogramming, but no one has found a way to halt, let
alone to recoup, the constant death of the brain. Already in Genghis
Mao's long life the estimated weight of his brain has declined by ten
percent, with a corresponding loss in mnemonic function and neural
response time; nevertheless he is far from senile, but what hideous
decline into idiocy might not overtake him if he were given a further
century or two of residence in his present cerebro-cerebellar
equipment? Hundreds of hapless primates have surrendered their
cranial contents to Irayne Sarafrazi's research, and their brains
live in bell jars on her laboratory benches, alive and responsive
while she seeks ways of tickling their neurons into new growth, but
no progress has been made. This morning she seems discouraged. Her
glittering Achaemenid eyes look dull and strained. The disembodied
brain of Pan, a chimpanzee, has suddenly undergone a fatal
deterioration, just when it appeared that some actual cellular growth
was beginning. &quot;We're about to begin the autopsy,'' Irayne
Sarafrazi says dismally, &quot;but we think Pan's death may mean our
whole cerebral stimulation program is a mistake. I'm thinking of
switching our emphasis away from actual brain regeneration and toward
redundancy activation. What do you think, Shadrach?&quot; Mordecai
shrugs. Of course he knows that the human brain has vast redundant
areas, billions of cells whose only apparent function is to be an
emergency reserve; he knows, too, what has been accomplished by way
of rehabilitating the victims of strokes and other cerebral damage
through redirecting the neural channels into the redundant areas. But
more efficient utilization of existing brain tissue only delays, does
not remove, the threat of senile degeneracy. So long as cells daily
die, Genghis Mao will tumble eventually into senility in his
rejuvenated body, fifty or seventy or ninety years from now, a
drooling Struldbrug of the mind trapped in a sturdy requickened
frame. &quot;Redundancy is a short-term measure,&quot; Shadrach tells
her. &quot;Without brain regeneration, the risks are too high. An old
brain in a young body won't work. Let me see the autopsy report on
the chimp tomorrow and maybe I'll have some ideas.&quot; Unable to
bear the sight of her stricken face, he tunes Sarafrazi out and gets
Nikki Crowfoot of Project Avatar on his screen. 
</P>
<P>She smiles tenderly. &quot;Did you sleep well,
Shadrach?&quot; Her strength, and the strength of her concern for
him, radiates glowingly from the screen. She is a stalwart woman, an
athlete, a huntress, tawny-skinned, big-breasted, nearly 190
centimeters tall, with a strong heavy-boned face, wide-set eyes,
wide-lipped mouth, assertive high-bridged nose. Her parents on both
sides were Amerindians, Navajo mother, detribalized Assiniboin
father. She and Shadrach Mordecai have been lovers for four months,
friends for more than a year. Mordecai hopes Genghis Mao knows
nothing of their affair, but he suspects it is a naive hope.</P>
<P>He says, &quot;I slept well for a while, anyway.&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;Worrying about the Chairman's operation?&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;I suppose. Or, maybe just worrying in
general.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I could have helped you relax,&quot; she
says with a sly grin. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Probably you could. But I've always
abstained the night before the Chairman undergoes surgery. Like a
prizefighter, like an opera singer. To keep the concentration
absolutely clear, the mind unblurred. I know it's silly, Nikki, but
it's something I do.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;All right. All right. I was only teasing.
Anyway, we can make up for it tonight.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Tonight, yes. Or this afternoon. We'll have
him off the table by 0230 hours. How would you like to take the
tunnel to Karakorum with me?&quot;</P>
<P>Nikki Crowfoot sighs. &quot;Can't. Don't tempt me.
Critical tests this afternoon. Do you want to hear my report?&quot;</P>
<P>Dr. Crowfoot's work overlaps, in some respects,
both the other projects, for Project Avatar's goal is to develop a
personality-transfer technique that will permit Genghis Mao&mdash;his
soul, his spirit, his persona, his anima, but no actual physical part
of him&mdash;to move to another, younger body. Like Project Talos,
Avatar strives to reduce the patterns of Genghis Mao's mental
responses to digital&mdash;therefore programmable, therefore
reproducible&mdash;codings; like Project Phoenix, Avatar intends to
give the Chairman a new and healthy body in which to dwell. But where
Talos would house the digital-coded analogue of Genghis Mao in a
mechanical construct. Avatar would use a real body of flesh and
blood; and where Phoenix would give the Chairman new vitality by
rejuvenating his own body, Avatar would place him in one formerly
inhabited by someone else, specifically Mangu. On the one hand
Crowfoot's project would avoid the inhumanity of creating a robot
Khan, on the other it would sidestep the problem of brain-cell
deterioration by instilling the intangible and abstract essence of
Genghis Mao in a young and vigorous brain. Despite the areas of
overlap, the three projects conduct their research altogether
independently of one another, and no attempts are made at exchanges
of ideas. Redundancy, after all, is our main avenue of survival.</P>
<P>Shadrach Mordecai, because he is privy to the work
of all three, is perhaps the only one who really knows where they
stand in relation to one another. He knows that Katya Lindman's team
is attempting something that is probably hopeless&mdash;instilling
the soul of a man into a machine will not produce a convincing and
politically viable duplicate of the original, machines ordinarily
being incapable of transcending their machinehood&mdash;and that
Irayne Sarafrazi' s group, though it is pursuing the most plausible
route toward giving Genghis Mao the eternal life he hungers for, is
destined to be blocked by the apparently insoluble brain-decay
difficulty. He knows, too, that Nikki Crowfoot's approach to
personality coding has been more fruitful than Lindman's, and that in
a matter of months it may be possible for the scientists of Project
Avatar to infuse the essence of Genghis Mao like a pervasive coating
of paint over the mind of a donor body whose previous occupant has
been obliterated by electroencephalographic mindpick techniques. Poor
Mangu. Poor hopeful tragic princeling, destined to be nothing better
than a <I>tabula rasa </I>for the Khan.</P>
<P>Mangu's fate will not be long delayed. Mordecai
listens in chilly fascination to Nikki's recitation of the latest
wonders. They have reached the stage where they can code the souls of
animals, abstracting from them the unique electrical patterns of
their minds, transforming those waveforms into numbers, using the
numbers to replicate the electrical patterns within the brains of
donor beasts. They have coded a rooster and pumped its soul into a
mindpicked hawk; hawk no longer flies, but runs cock-a-doodling
around the chicken coop, clumsily fluttering its magnificent wings
and crazily mounting the terrified hens. They have coded a gibbon and
housed its <I>mind </I>in a gorilla's body; gorilla has turned
berserkly arboreal, brachiating in wild desperation through the
treetops, while its evicted gorilla-essence now resides within a
former gibbon that struts ponderously at ground level, leaning on its
flexed knuckles and pausing occasionally to pound its scrawny chest.
And so on, and so on; they are getting ready to attempt the first
human transfers, within a matter of weeks. Mordecai does not ask
Crowfoot where she intends to obtain her experimental subjects. There
are confusing problems of ethics as it is in this whole business of
serving Genghis Mao; he would rather not load his conscience with his
beloved's deeds.</P>
<P>&quot;Call me when the operation's over,&quot;
Nikki Crowfoot tells him</P>
<P>&quot;Won't that interrupt your critical tests?&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;Not critically. Call me. I'll see you
tonight.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Tonight, yes,&quot; Shadrach says faintly. 
</P>
<P>The time is 0855 hours. He must convey Genghis Mao
now to the Surgery.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3>4</H3>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>The liver, the body's largest gland, is a useful
and complex organ weighing a kilogram and a half&mdash;about two
percent of the total body weight &mdash;that performs hundreds of
significant biochemical functions. The liver produces bile, a green
liquid essential to digestion. Through the liver passes exhausted
venous blood en route to the heart, blood which the liver filters <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">to</SPAN><I>
</I>remove bacteria, poisons, drugs, and other noxious impurities. To
the blood the liver adds the plasma proteins it manufactures, among
them the clotting agent fibrinogen and the anticoagulant heparin.
From the blood the liver takes sugar, which it converts to glycogen
and stores until the body's energy needs require it. The liver is
responsible also for the conversion of fats and proteins into
carbohydrates, the storage of fat-soluble vitamins, the manufacture
of antibodies, the destruction of outworn red blood cells, and much
else.</P>
<P>So many metabolic purposes does the liver serve
that no vertebrate can survive more than a few hours without one. So
central is it to life that it has extraordinary regenerative powers:
if three quarters of the liver is removed, the remaining cells will
multiply so rapidly that the gland will regain its original
dimensions within two months. Even if ninety percent of the liver is
destroyed, it continues to produce bile at the normal rate.
Redundancy is our main avenue of survival. Nevertheless the liver is
subject to many dysfunctions&mdash;the various jaundices, the various
necroses, septicemia, dysenteric abscesses, cancer of the bile
passages, and so forth. The liver's totipotence enables it to
withstand such dysfunctions for prolonged periods, but its powers of
recuperation diminish, like most other things, with age.</P>
<P>Genghis Mao suffers from chronic liver trouble. To
sustain his life and the life of the assorted artificial and
transplanted organs within him, the Chairman must pour oceans of
medication through his system each day, and even the most durable of
livers would be hard pressed to handle the constant assault of
high-powered chemicals it is asked to filter from Genghis Mao's
bloodstream. Then, too, the presence of so many alien organs sets up
biochemical interaction phenomena within the body that the liver must
counteract, and the strain is telling. The Chairman's beleaguered
liver is in a perpetually morbid state, aggravated by his great age
and the unnatural intricacy of his composite internal structure, and
periodically it must be replaced. That time has again come.</P>
<P>Two burly aides lift Genghis Mao's short, slight
figure onto a gurney and the familiar trip from the imperial
bedchamber to the operating table commences. The Khan is cheerful,
feverish and frail and beady-eyed though he looks; he nods and winks
to the aides as they position him, telling them that he is
comfortable; he chuckles, he even essays a quip or two. Mordecai is
astounded, as always, by the Khan's incredible calmness at such a
moment, as evidenced by the telemetered data reaching his implanted
sensors. Surely Genghis Mao knows that there is a significant chance
of his dying during the operation, but his somatic output registers
no apparent awareness of that&mdash;as though the Chairman's spirit
is so neatly balanced between love of life and hunger for death that
it floats in perfect metabolic equilibrium. At any rate Shadrach is
much less relaxed than his employer, perhaps because he regards the
risks of a liver transplant operation as distinctly nontrivial and is
far from ready to confront the personal uncertainties of a
post-Genghis Mao world.</P>
<P>On silent pneumatic treads the gurney bearing the
Chairman glides from the imperial bedchamber to the imperial office,
thence via the private dining room into Shadrach Mordecai's office,
and&mdash;after an eternity of suspicious scanning&mdash;through
Interface Five into the Surgery. This is a magnificent tetrahedral
enclosure extending through the uppermost two stories of the Grand
Tower of the Khan and subtending some thirty degrees of arc along the
skin of the elongated conical building. A cruciform cluster of
chromed fixtures at the room's summit floods it with brilliant but
not glaring light. A platform midway between floor and ceiling juts
from the wall opposite the interface, dividing the great room almost
in half on its far side, and atop this platform rests the dazzling
aseptic transparent bubble within which the actual surgery is
performed; beneath the platform that supports the bubble is the
surgical stage's environment-support apparatus: a huge sinister
hooded cube of dull green metal, housing what Mordecai imagines <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">to</SPAN><I>
</I>be pumps, filters, heating ducts, reservoirs of sterilizing
chemicals, humidifiers, and other equipment. On the other side of the
room is a ziggurat of supplementary machinery rising step by step on
smooth blue-green benches for some thirty meters&mdash;a squat
brick-colored power unit at the bottom, an array of metering devices,
an autoclave, a laser bank, the anesthesia console, a camera boom and
associated playback screens to enable consulting doctors to follow
the events inside the bubble, and much other materiel, some of it
wholly baffling to Mordecai.</P>
<P>He does not need to understand what functions all
this equipment serves. He will perform no actual surgery. His role in
the operation is as part of the auxiliary equipment&mdash;for, with
his capability to monitor, evaluate, and report on the
moment-by-moment physiological changes within Genghis Mao's body, he
is a kind of supercomputer, far more supple and perceptive than any
medical machine could be. The Chairman's condition will, of course,
be monitored by the usual machinery as well (redundancy is our main
avenue . . .) but Shadrach, standing at Warhaftig's elbow and
receiving direct bulletins from the Khan's interior, will be able to
interpret and recommend with an intuitive and deductive wisdom that
no machine could attempt. He is neither flattered nor insulted by his
function as a supercomputer: it is merely what he is here to do. The
gurney waddles onto the operating stage and positions itself next to
the table. The table's own octopuslike, power-driven, glittering
steel arms, extending telescopically, embrace Genghis Mao, lift him,
and make the transfer; the gurney marches away. Mordecai, Warhaftig,
and Warhaftig's two assistants, all properly scrubbed and gowned,
enter the aseptic bubble; it is sealed behind them and will not open
again until the operation is over. Now a soft hissing: the atmosphere
of the bubble is being withdrawn and replaced by a surgically clean
environment.</P>
<P>Genghis Mao, supine but still conscious and in
high spirits, darts bright, keen glances everywhere, alertly
observing each phase of the preparations. The assistants lay bare the
Chairman's small hard torso&mdash;Genghis Mao is light-framed but
muscular, with little subcutaneous fat and sparse body hair; the fine
scars of innumerable operations crisscross his yellow-bronze skin&mdash;and
begin the laborious process of connecting the terminals of the
monitoring devices. Warhaftig thoughtfully palpates the Khan's
abdomen and adjusts the cutting angle of the surgical laser. The
anesthesiologist, whose post is outside the bubble, runs off
preliminary acupuncture combinations on his keyboard. &quot;Hook up
the perfusion,&quot; Warhaftig mutters absently to Shadrach Mordecai,
who is pleased to have something to do.</P>
<P>Since Genghis Mao will be liverless for four to
six hours, an artificial liver must be used to sustain him during the
operation. But no wholly artificial liver has ever been perfected,
not even now, after more than fifty years of organ-transplant
technology. The squat cubical device Warhaftig employs is a
mechano-organic composite: pipes, tubes, pumps, and electrodialytic
filters keep the patient's blood properly pure, but the basic
biochemical functions of the liver, having thus far proven impossible
to duplicate mechanically, are performed by the naked liver of a dog,
resting in a bath of warm fluid at the core of the apparatus.
Mordecai deftly slides two needles into Genghis Mao's upper arm, one
tapping a vein, the other entering an artery. The arterial line seems
to encounter some resistance and Shadrach hesitates. The Chairman
winks. This is old stuff to him. &quot;Go ahead,&quot; he murmurs.
&quot;I'm all right.&quot; Mordecai completes the hookup and nods to
an assistant. Shortly the Chairman's blood is traveling toward the
dialyzing coils, perfusing thereafter through the moist red lobes of
the canine liver, and returning to the Chairman's body. Shadrach
keeps careful check on Genghis Mao's telemeter reports: fine, fine,
everything fine. &quot;Immunosuppressives,&quot; Warhaftig orders.
For several weeks, in anticipation of the operation, Mordecai has
been dosing the Khan with antimetabolitic drugs, gradually raising
the level in order to damp out Genghis Mao's normal graft-rejecting
immune response. By now the Khan's antigenic structure has been so
weakened that the chance of a graft rejection is slight, but no risks
will be run: Genghis Mao receives a last jolt of antimetabolites now,
as well as a dose of corticosteroids, and an aide outside the bubble
activates a node that will irradiate the blood passing through the
liver-surrogate, thus destroying the rejection-inducing lymphocyte
corpuscles. Redundancy, redundancy, ever redundancy! The Khan's heart
beats strongly. Everything is at normal throb, Mordecai perceives:
blood pressure, pulse, body temperature, peristaltic rhythm, muscle
tonus, pupil dilation, muscular reflexes. &quot;Anesthesia,&quot;
Warhaftig says.</P>
<P>The anesthesiologist, perched high on the far wall
at the keyboard of an instrument more complicated than a concert
synthesizer, begins his virtuoso performance. A touch of his
sensitive fingertips and the shining retractable claws of the
operating table unfold and hover over the Chairman's body. The
anesthesiologist seeks the acupuncture points, maneuvering the claws
into place by remote control, probing with little sonic blurts until
he finds the precise conduits of neural energy; when he has arranged
his metal fingers to his satisfaction, he activates the ultrasonic
generators and beams of sonic force rush from the hovering fingers
into the Khan's relaxed, motionless body. No acupuncture needles
penetrate Genghis Mao, merely a laminar flow of high-frequency sound
entering the acupuncture meridians. Warhaftig, using epidermal
electrodes, tests the Khan's reactions, confers with the
anesthesiologist, tests again, asks Mordecai for a reading, runs a
deeper test, gets no wince of pain from Genghis Mao. The steel digits
of the sonipuncture equipment sparkle in the bright light of the
operating chamber; they surround Genghis Mao like the bristly organs
of insects, palps or stings or ovipositors. Genghis Mao never permits
a general anesthetic to be administered to him&mdash;loss of
consciousness is too much like death&mdash;and Warhaftig dislikes all
chemical anesthetics, general or local, so sonipuncture is the method
of choice both for doctor and for patient. Fully conscious still,
terrifyingly alert, Genghis Mao offers reports on his deepening loss
of sensation. At last Warhaftig and the anesthesiologist deem the
process complete.</P>
<P>&quot;We begin now,&quot; the surgeon declares.</P>
<P>There is a momentary dip in the illumination as
all surgical devices and support systems are activated at once.
Mordecai imagines a throb passing through the entire building under
the sudden power demand. To the left of the operating table is the
perfusion machine, quietly pumping blood from Genghis Mao and forcing
it through the dialysis coils. To the right waits the new liver,
which has been stored in an iced saline solution since its removal
from the donor and now is being bathed by warm fluids bringing it to
body temperature. Warhaftig checks his laser bank one last time and,
with a quick jab of a long bony finger against the control stud,
causes a flash of dazzling purple light to leap forth and cut a thin
red incision in Genghis Mao's abdomen. The Khan remains entirely
motionless. The surgeon glances at Shadrach, who says, &quot;All
systems placid. Keep going.&quot;</P>
<P>Deftly, Warhaftig slices deeper. As he makes each
cut, scanners record the epidermal stratifications down to the
cellular level, so that all joins will be perfect when the abdominal
cavity is resealed. Bright steel retractors move automatically into
place to hold the widening incision. The Khan watches the early
phases with deep fascination, but, as his internal organs are laid
bare, he turns his head away and stares toward the domed ceiling.
Perhaps he finds the sight of his viscera frightening or repellent,
Mordecai thinks, but more likely the Chairman is merely bored with
them, having been cut open so many times.</P>
<P>Now the dark diseased liver is visible, heavy,
spongy, sullen in color. Warhaftig, fingers moving like unerring
spindles, clamps the arteries and veins connected to it. With quick
daredevil flicks of his laser scalpel he severs the portal vein, the
hepatic artery, the inferior vena cava, the ligamentum teres, and the
bile duct. &quot;Done,&quot; he murmurs, and Genghis Mao's third
liver is lifted from his abdomen. Away for biopsy; the fourth waits
close by, large and plump and healthy, resting within a crystalline
jewel-case.</P>
<P>The surgeon and his team commence the most taxing
part of the operation. Any pigsticker can make an incision, but only
an artist can execute perfect sutures. Warhaftig seals flesh to flesh
with a different laser, one that welds rather than cuts. Slowly,
showing no sign of fatigue, he connects the closed-off arteries,
veins, and bile duct to the new liver. Genghis Mao is limp, almost
comatose now, eyes glazed, lips slack: Shadrach Mordecai has seen
this response before and understands it well. It is a sign neither of
exhaustion nor of shock. It is no more than a kind of yogic exercise
by which the Chairman disassociates himself from the boredom of his
long ordeal. His vital signs are still high, with a preponderance of
alpha rhythms in the cerebral output. Warhaftig toils on. The liver
has been installed. The Khan's pulse rate rises and corrective
measures must be taken, but this is to be expected; no cause for
alarm. Meticulously Warhaftig rejoins peritoneum and muscular layers
and dermis and epidermis, collaborating in this process with the
computer that feeds him the stratification data. Every join is
flawless. Scar formation will be minimal. Now the abdominal wall is
closed. Warhaftig steps back, cool, self-satisfied, and lesser beings
take over. The transplant has been accomplished in exactly five
hours. Mordecai leans forward to study Genghis Mao's face. The
Chairman sleeps, so it would seem, facial muscles relaxed, eyes
quiescent, chest rising and falling evenly; but no, but no, the mere
shadow of Shadrach seems to register on the Khan's consciousness, for
his thin lips pull back in a frosty smile; his left eye opens and
performs an unmistakable wink.</P>
<P>&quot;Well, that's another one over with,&quot;
Genghis Mao says, his voice firm and clear.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3>5</H3>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>And so, in early evening, the day's work done and
his Hippocratic responsibilities well discharged, it is off to
Karakorum, the playground of this weary world's ruling class, for
Shadrach Mordecai, with Nikki Crowfoot as his playmate. He picks her
up three hours after the operation in the Project Avatar laboratory
on the seventh level of the Grand Tower of the Khan. A great
green-walled barn of a place it is, experimental animals caged
everywhere, crazy animals, cockadoodling hawks and tree-climbing
gorillas, and colossal banks of testing equipment wherever there are
no cages. There is a laboratory stink to the air down here, a stink
Mordecai remembers well from his Harvard Med days, a mix of Lysol and
formaldehyde and ethyl alcohol and mouse shit and Bunsen-burner fumes
and burned insulation and what-all else. Most of the Avatar staff has
left for the day, but Crowfoot, in gray lab smock and battered
sandals, is busy at a five-meter-high agglomeration of computers and
playback heads and television screens when he comes in. She stands
with her back to the door, watching pyrotechnic bursts of green,
blue, and red erupt and wiggle wildly across the face of a gigantic
oscilloscope. Shadrach slips up behind her and, sliding his hands
under her arms, cups her breasts through the smock. Her back goes
rigid at the first touch of his fingers, but then she relaxes
immediately, and does not turn around.</P>
<P>&quot;Idiot,&quot; she says, but there is only
affection in her voice. &quot;Don't distract me. I'm running a triple
simulation. That's a real Genghis Mao tape down there, the green, and
the blue above it is our April seven persona-construct, and&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Forget it. Genghis Mao died on the table
when we pulled his liver out. The revolution started an hour ago. The
city&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>She squirms in his embrace, pulling around,
staring wide-eyed at him, aghast.</P>
<P>&quot;&mdash;is in flames, and if you listen you
can hear the explosions where they're blowing up the statues&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>She sees his expression and begins to laugh,
&quot;Idiot! <I>Idiot!&quot;</I></P>
<P>&quot;Actually, he's doing fine, even though
Warhaftig put the new liver in upside down.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Stop it, Shadrach.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;All right. He really is in good shape. He
took ten minutes off to recuperate and now he's leading Mongol-style
square-dancing in Committee Vector One.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Shadrach&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I can't help it. I'm in my postoperative
manic phase.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, I'm not. It's been a garbage day
here.&quot; Indeed her depression is obvious, once he slows down long
enough to perceive it: her eyes are strained, her face is tense, her
shoulders are uncharacteristically slumped.</P>
<P>&quot;Your tests came out bad?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;We blew them altogether. Hit a feedback loop
and wiped three key tapes before we knew what was happening. I'm
trying to salvage what's left. We've been set back a month, a month
and a half.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Poor Nikki. Is there any way I can help?&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;Just get me out of here,&quot; she says.
&quot;Amuse me. Distract me. Make funny faces. How <I>did </I>the
operation go?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Flawless. Warhaftig's a wizard. He could do
a nuclear implant on an amoeba with his thumbs and bring it off.&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;The great man rests well?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Beautifully,&quot; Mordecai says. ''It's
almost obscene, the way an eighty-seven-year-old man bounces back
from major surgery like this every five or six weeks.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Is that what he is, eighty-seven?&quot; 
</P>
<P>Shadrach shrugs. &quot;That's what the official
figure is. There are stories that he's older, perhaps a lot older,
ninety, ninety-five, even past a hundred, they say. Rumors that he
served in World War II. What we're talking about, of course, is the
brain, the epidermal integument, and the skeletal structure. The rest
of him's been cobbled together relatively recently out of fresh
parts. A lung here, a kidney there, dacron arteries, ceramic hip
joints, a plastic esophagus, a molybdenum-chromium shoulder, a new
liver every few years&mdash;how it all hangs together I don't know.
But he just gets younger and younger, stronger and stronger, wilier
and wilier. You ought to hear his vital signs ticking away in here.&quot;</P>
<P>Grinning, Nikki Crowfoot puts her hands to
Shadrach's thighs as though to feel the sensor implants. &quot;Ye-es.
He's doing marvelously well for his age. At the moment he's
fornicating a nurse. Wait, Wait. I think he's coming! No, it's a
sneeze. And now <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">I</SPAN><I> </I>pick
up audio input. Gezundheit, she just said. How is Genghis Mao's sex
life, anyway?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I try not to ask.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Doesn't your inner machinery tell you?&quot;
</P>
<P><I>&quot;Honi soit qui mal y pense,&quot; </I>Mordecai
says. &quot;Doubtless he's got a splendid sex life. Probably more
active than mine.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;You didn't <I>have </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">to</SPAN><I>
</I>sleep alone last night.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;My vocation demanded it of me.&quot; He
gestures toward the door. &quot;Karakorum?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Karakorum, yes. But first I need to wash and
change.&quot;</P>
<P>They go to her apartment, forty stories higher in
the building. All important members of Genghis Mao's staff have
lodgings in the tower; but a research-group director has far less
prestige than the Chairman's personal physician, and Crowfoot's suite
is not nearly as opulent as Shadrach Mordecai's, just three rooms,
plain furnishings, floors of common wood, no balcony, a sliver of a
view. Shadrach settles into a webfoam lounger while Nikki strips and
heads for the shower. Her bare body is strikingly beautiful, and
desire stirs in him at the sight of her heavy dark-tipped breasts,
her powerful thighs, her flat hard belly. She is long and lean, with
strong shoulders, a narrow waist, sudden flaring hips, sleek muscular
buttocks; a dense flood of thick black hair descends to the middle of
her back. Unclothed she sheds the laboratory aura, the tense and
fatigued look of the dissatisfied scientist, and becomes something
primitive, barbaric, primordial&mdash;Pocahontas, Sacajawea,
moon-begotten Nokomis. Once when he made such feverish comparisons
when they were in bed together she became embarrassed and
self-conscious, and mockingly, defensively, called him Othello and
Ras Tafari and Chaka Zulu; never again has he overtly romanticized
her savage ancestry, for he does not like to be twitted about his
own, but the feeling persists, whenever she bares herself to him,
that she is a princess of a fallen nation, high priestess of the
great plains, red Amazon of the pagan night. She emerges and dons a
floor-length robe of openwork golden mesh, blatantly provocative, the
antithesis of her epicene lab smock. Chocolate nipples show through,
hints of the blue-black wire-stiff pubic triangle, flashes of haunch
and thigh. He would gladly bed her this moment, but he knows she is
tired and hungry, still preoccupied with the failures of the day, not
yet at all in the mood for making love, and in any case she usually
dislikes afternoon couplings, preferring to let erotic tensions build
through the evening. So he contents himself with a light playful kiss
and an appreciative smile, and out they go, down to the depths of the
tower, to the loading ramp of the Karakorum tube-train.</P>
<P>Karakorum lies four hundred kilometers west of
Ulan Bator. Five years ago a nuclear-powered subterrene drilled a
wide tunnel connecting the two cities beneath the Central Gobi, its
invincible thermal-stress penetrator slicing serenely through the
resistant deep-lying Paleozoic granites and schists. Now high-speed
trains on silent inertialess tracks sweep between the ancient capital
and the modern one, making the journey in less than an hour. Shadrach
Mordecai and Nikki Crowfoot join the pleasure-bound throngs on the
platform; the next train is due to depart in just a few minutes.
Several people greet them but no one comes close. There is something
formidable and intimidating about a truly impressive-looking couple,
something that seals them within a zone of chilly unapproachability,
and Shadrach knows he and Nikki are impressive, tall slender black
man and tall sturdy copper-skinned woman, handsome of form and face,
elegantly dressed, Othello and Pocahontas out for a night on the
town. But there is another isolating factor at work&mdash;Dr.
Mordecai's professional proximity to the Khan: these people are aware
that he has face-to-face access to Genghis Mao, one of the very few,
and some of the Chairman's aura has been transferred to him, a
contagion of awesomeness, making Mordecai one not to be approached
casually. He dislikes this but there is little he can do about it.</P>
<P>The tube-train pulls in. Off now to Karakorum go
Shadrach and Nikki.</P>
<P>Karakorum. Founded eight hundred years ago by
Genghis Khan. Transformed into a majestic capital by Genghis's son
Ogodai. Abandoned a generation later by Genghis's grandson Kublai,
who preferred to rule from Cambaluc in China. Destroyed by Kublai
Khan when his rebellious younger brother attempted to make it the
seat of his revolt. Rebuilt eventually, abandoned again, allowed to
fall into decay, forgotten entirely. Its site rediscovered in the
middle of the twentieth century by archaeologists of the Mongolian
People's Republic and the Soviet Union. And now much restored by
decree of Genghis II Mao IV Khan, self-anointed successor to one
ancient empire and one modern one, who wishes to remind the world of
the greatness of Genghis I and to make it forget the centuries of
Mongol slumber that followed the decline of the Khans.</P>
<P>Karakorum by night glitters with an unearthly
brightness, a stunning lunar glow. Mordecai and Crowfoot, leaving the
tube train station, behold the excavated ruins of old Karakorum to
their left&mdash;a solitary stone tortoise in a field of yellowed
grass, the outlines of some brick walls, a shattered pillar. Nearby
are gray stone stupas, monuments to holy lamas, erected in the
sixteenth century; in the distance, against the parched hills, are
the white stucco buildings of Karakorum State Farm, a grandiose
project of the defunct Mongolian People's Republic, a vast
agricultural enterprise occupying half a million hectares of
grassland. Between the farm buildings and the stupas lies the
Karakorum of Genghis Mao, a flamboyant reconstruction of the original
city, the great many-columned walled palace of Ogodai Khan imagined
anew, the splendid observatory with its heaven-stabbing turrets, the
mosques and churches, the gaudy silken tents of the nobility, the
somber brick houses of the foreign merchants, all testifying to the
might and magnificence of the latter-day Prince of Princes, Genghis
Mao, who, according to a half-suppressed legend, had once had a
humbler Mongol name, Choijamise or Ochirbal or Gombojab&mdash; the
tales vary according to the teller&mdash;and had been a minor
functionary, a very insignificant <I>apparatchik, </I>in the
bureaucracy of the old People's Republic in the vanished
Marxist-Leninist days, before the world fell apart and a new Mongol
empire was constructed on its relict. The resurrected Karakorum is
not merely a sterile monument to antiquity, though: by Genghis Mao's
decree it is an amusement park, a place of revelry and pleasures, a
twenty-first-century Xanadu blazing with frantic energy. In these
black and yellow and scarlet tents one may dine, drink, gamble; the
latest hallucinations are for sale here; here one may find willing
sexual partners of all kinds; those who indulge in the popular cults
of the moment&mdash;dream-death, transtemporalism, and carpentry are
the fashionable ones just now&mdash;have facilities for their rituals
in Karakorum. Shadrach is a carpentry-cultist himself; Nikki Crowfoot
goes in for transtemporalism, and he has dabbled in that too, though
not lately. Once he came to Karakocum with Karya Lindman, and that
fierce, intense woman urged him to try dream-death with her, but he
refused, and she scorned him for his timidity for days afterward. Not
with words. Little castrating scowls; sudden harsh flickers of her
furious eyes. Mocking quiverings of her elegant nostrils.</P>
<P>As they pass the dream-death pavilion now, neither
of them giving it more than a casual glance, Mordecai forcing the
image of Katya Lindman's bare blazing body out of his mind, Crowfoot
says, &quot;Isn't it risky, your going this far from Ulan Bator only
a few hours after he's had major surgery?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Not especially. In fact, I always go out the
evening after a transplant. A little bonus I give myself after a hard
day's work. If anything, it's a better time for a Karakorum trip than
most.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Why so?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;He's in an intensive-care support system
tonight. If any complications set in, alarms will go off all over the
place and one of the low-echelon medics will respond instantly. You
know, my job doesn't require me to hold the boss's hand twenty-five
hours a day. It isn't needed and he doesn't want it.&quot;</P>
<P>Fireworks abruptly explode overhead. Wheels of
gold and crimson, spears coursing across the night. Shadrach imagines
he sees the face of Genghis Mao filling the sky, but no, but no, just
self-deception, the pattern is plainly abstract. Plainly.</P>
<P>&quot;If an emergency comes up, they'll summon
you, won't they?&quot; Nikki asks.</P>
<P>&quot;They won't need to,&quot; Mordecai tells
her. Out of the dream-death pavilion comes a weird discordant music,
bagpipes gone awry. He thinks of Katya Lindman crooning in Swedish an
hour before the dawn one snowy night, and shivers. He pats his thigh
where the implants are and says, &quot;I'm getting the full
broadcast, remember?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Even out here?&quot;</P>
<P>He nods. &quot;The telemetering range is about a
thousand kilometers. I'm picking him up clearly right this minute.
He's resting very comfortably, dozing, I'd say, temperature about a
degree above normal, pulse very slightly high, new liver integrating
itself nicely and already making positive changes in his general
metabolic state. If anything starts deteriorating, I'll know about it
immediately, and if necessary I can always get back to him in ninety
minutes or so. Meanwhile I'm covered and I'm free to amuse myself.&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;Always aware of the state of his health.&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes. Always. Even while I sleep, the
information ticks into me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Your implants fascinate me philosophically,&quot;
she says. They pause at a sweets-vendor's booth to buy some
refreshments. The vendor, a squat thick-nosed Mongol, offers them
airag, the ancient Mongol beverage of fermented mare's milk, and,
shrugging, Mordecai takes a flask for her and one for himself. She
makes a face, but drinks, and says, &quot;What I mean is, looking at
you and the Chairman in strict cybernetic terms, it's hard to see
where the boundaries of your individuality end and his begin. You and
he amount to a single self-corrective information-processing unit,
practically a single life system.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That's not exactly how I see it,&quot;
Mordecai tells her. &quot;There may be a constant flow of metabolic
information from his body to mine, and the information I receive from
him has some impact on the course of my actions and I suppose
ultimately on his, but he remains an autonomous being, the Chairman
of the PRC, no less, with all the tremendous power that that entails,
and I am only&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No. Look at it with a total-systems
approach,&quot; Crowfoot urges impatiently. &quot;Let's say you're
Michelangelo, trying to turn a huge block of marble into the <I>David.
</I>The figure is within the marble: you must liberate it with your
mallet and chisel, right? You strike the block; a chip of marble is
knocked off. You strike it again. Another chip. A few more chips and
perhaps the outline of an arm begins to emerge. The angle of the
chisel is slightly different for each stroke, isn't it? And maybe the
intensity of the force you use to hit the chisel with the mallet is
different, too. You constantly modify and correct your strokes
according to the information you're receiving from the cul face of
the marble block&mdash;the emerging shape, the right cleavage planes,
and soon. Do you see the total system? The process of creating
Michelangelo's <I>David </I>isn't one in which you, Michelangelo,
simply act on a passive lump of stone. The marble's an active force
too, part of the circuit, in a sense part of the mind system that is
Michelangelo-as-sculptor. Because&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I don't&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Let me finish. Let me trace the whole
circuit for you. A change in the outline of the marble is perceived
by your eye and is evaluated by your brain, which transmits
instructions to the muscles of your arm having to do with the force
and angle of the next blow, and this causes a change in your
neuromuscular response as you strike the next blow, producing further
change in the marble that causes further perception of change in the
eye and a further alteration of program within the brain, leading to
another correction of neuromuscular response for the next stroke, and
so on, on and on around the loop until the statue is done. The
process of carving the statue is a process of perceiving and
responding to change, to stroke-by-stroke difference; and the block
of marble is an essential part of the total system.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It didn't ask to be,&quot; Shadrach says
mildly. &quot;It doesn't <I>know </I>it's part of a system.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Irrelevant. View the system as a closed
universe. The marble is changing and its changes produce changes
within Michelangelo that lead to further changes in the marble.
Within the closed universe of sculptor-and-tools-and-marble, it's
incorrect to view Michelangelo as the 'self,' the actor, and the
marble as a 'thing,' the acted-upon. Sculptor and tools and marble
together make up a single network of causal pathways, a single
thinking-and-acting-and-changing entity, <I>a single person, </I>if
you will. Now, you and Genghis Mao&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Are different persons,&quot; Mordecai
insists. &quot;The feedback's not the same. If his kidney conks out,
I react to the extent that I perceive the malfunction and treat it
and arrange for a kidney replacement, but I won't get sick myself.
And if something goes wrong with <I>my </I>kidneys, it won't affect
him in any way.&quot;</P>
<P>Crowfoot shrugs. &quot;True but trivial. Don't you
see that the causal interlock between the two of you is much more
intimate? Your whole daily routine is controlled by the transmissions
you get from Genghis Mao: you sleep alone or sleep with me depending
on his health, you go to Karakorum or stay by his bedside, you
experience somatic anxieties if the signal from him starts going
critical, you have a whole constellation of life-choices and
life-responses that are governed almost entirely by his metabolism.
You're an extension of Genghis Mao. And what about him? He lives or
dies at your option. He may be Chairman of the PRC, but he would be
just another dead man next week if you fail to pick up some key
symptom or fail to take the proper corrective action. You're
essential to his survival, and he controls many of your movements and
actions. One system, Shadrach, one constantly resonating circuit, you
and Genghis Mao, Genghis Mao and you!&quot;</P>
<P>Still Shadrach Mordecai shakes his head. &quot;The
analogy's close, but not close enough to convince me. Not quite close
enough. I'm equipped with some extraordinary diagnostic devices,
sure, but they're not all that special; my implants help me respond
faster to emergencies than an ordinary doctor might respond to an
ordinary patient, but that's all. It's only a quantitative
difference. You can define any doctor-patient unit as a single
self-corrective information-processing system, of sorts, but I don't
think the hookup between Genghis Mao and myself creates any kind of
significant difference in that type of system. If I got sick when he
got sick, the point would be valid, but&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>Nikki Crowfoot sighs. &quot;Let it pass, Shadrach.
It isn't worth all this palaver. In the Avatar lab we constantly have
to deal with the principle that the popular notion of self is pretty
meaningless, that it's necessary to think in terms of larger
information-handling systems, but maybe I'm extending the principle
into areas where it doesn't need to go. Or maybe you and I simply
aren't communicating very well right now.'' She closes her eyes for a
moment and clenches her jaws as if trying to discharge some jangling
current pulsing through her brain. Another barrage of fireworks
lights up the sky with garish purple and green streaks. Savage thorny
music, all snarls and shrieks, pierces the air. After a moment
Crowfoot relaxes, grins, points to the shimmering tent of the
transtemporalists a few meters in front of them. &quot;Enough talk,&quot;
she says. &quot;Now some excitement.&quot;</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3>6</H3>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;I shall explain the method of our rite, if
you wish,&quot; says the transtemporalist. Deep slurred Mongol voice,
monolithic face, all nose and cheekbones, the eyes hidden in shadows.</P>
<P>&quot;Not necessary,&quot; Mordecai tells him.
&quot;I've been here before.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah. Of course.&quot; An obsequious little
bow. &quot;I was not sure of that, Dr. Mordecai.&quot;</P>
<P>Shadrach is accustomed to being recognized.
Mongolia is full of foreigners but very few of them are black. The
sound of his own name, therefore, gives him only the most fleeting
jab of surprise. Still, he would have welcomed more anonymity here.
The transtemporalist kneels and beckons to him to do the same. They
are in a private little cubicle, formed by thick carpets draped over
ropes, within the vast dim tent. A thick yellow candle set in a
pewter cup on the earthen floor flickers between them sending a heavy
spiral of dark sour smoke toward the tent's sloping top. In
Mordecai's nostrils are all sorts of primeval Mongol odors, the reek
of shaggy goatskin walls, the stench of what might well be a cow-dung
fire somewhere nearby. The floor is densely strewn with soft wood
shavings, a luxury in this land of few trees. The transtemporalist is
busy at the chemistry of his vocation, mixing fluids in a tall pewter
beaker, an oily blue one and a thin scarlet one, stirring them around
with an ivory swizzle stick that makes lively swirl patterns, adding
now a sprinkle of a green powder and a yellow one. Hocus-pocus, all
of it: Mordecai suspects that only one of these substances is the
true drug, the others being mere decoration. But rites demand mystery
and color, and these dour priests, claiming all of time and space for
their province, must heighten their effects as best they can.
Shadrach wonders how far from him Nikki is now. They were parted at
the entrance to the transtemporalists' maze of a tent, each led
separately into the shadows by silent acolytes. The time voyage is a
journey that one must take alone.</P>
<P>The Mongol concludes his pharmaceutics and,
holding the cup tenderly in both hands, passes it above the candle's
sputtering flame to Shadrach Mordecai.</P>
<P>&quot;Drink,&quot; he says, and, feeling a bit
like Tristan, Shadrach drinks. Surrenders the cup. Sits back on his
haunches, waiting. &quot;Give me your hands,&quot; the
transtemporalist murmurs. Shadrach extends them, palms upward. The
Mongol covers them with his own short-fingered wide-spanned hands and
intones some gibberish prayer, unintelligible except for scattered
Mongol words that have no contextual coherence, A faint dizziness is
beginning in Shadrach Mordecai now. This will be his third
transtemporal experience, the first in nearly a year. Once he visited
the court of King Baldwin of Jerusalem in the guise of a black prince
of Ethiopia, a Christian Moor at the swaggering feasts of the
Crusaders; and once he found himself atop a stone pyramid in Mexico,
robed all in white, slashing with an obsidian dagger at the breast of
a writhing Spaniard spread-eagled on the sacrificial altar of
Huitzilopitchli. And now? He will have no choice in his destination.
The transtemporalist will choose it for him according to some
unfathomable whim, aiming him with a word or two, a skillful
suggestion as he is cut loose from his moorings by the drug and sent
adrift into the living past. His own imagination and historical
knowledge, coupled with, perhaps&mdash; who knows?&mdash;whispered
cues from the transtemporalist as his drugged body lies on the floor
of the tent&mdash;will do the rest. 
</P>
<P>Mordecai sways now. Everything whirls. The
transtemporalist leans close and speaks, and it is a struggle to
comprehend the words, but Shadrach must comprehend, he needs to hear&mdash;</P>
<P>&quot;It is the night of Cotopaxi,&quot; the
Mongol whispers. &quot;Red sun, yellow sky.&quot;</P>
<P>The tent disappears and Shadrach is alone.</P>
<P>Where is he? A city. Not Karakorum. This place is
unfamiliar, subtropical, narrow streets, steep hills, iron-grilled
doorways, twining red-flowered vines, cool clear air, grand fountains
in spacious plazas, white-fronted houses with wrought-iron balconies.
A Latin city, intense, hectic, busy.</P>
<P>&mdash;<I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">&iexcl;</FONT>Barato
aqui! Barato!</I></P>
<P>&mdash; <I>Yo tengo un hambre canina.</I></P>
<P>Honking horns, barking dogs, the shouts of
children, the cries of vendors. Women roasting bits of meat over
charcoal braziers in the cobbled streets. A thousand strident
people-sounds. Where is there a city with such vigorous life? Why
does no one show signs of the organ-rot? They are all so healthy
here, even the beggars, even the paupers. There are no such cities.
No more, no more. Ah. Naturally. He is dreaming a city mat no longer
exists. This is a city of yesterday.</P>
<P>&mdash;<I>Le telefonear<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">&eacute;</FONT>

<P>&mdash;<I>Hasta la semana que viene.</I></P>
<P>He has never spoken Spanish. And yet he recognizes
the words, and yet he understands them.</P>
<P>&mdash;<I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">&iquest;</FONT>Donde

<P>&mdash;<I>No es verdad.</I></P>
<P>Standing in the middle of a busy street at the top
of a broad hill, he is stunned by the view. Mountains! They rim the
city, great snowcapped cones, gleaming in the midday sun. He has
lived too long on the Mongolian plateau; mountains such as these have
become unfamiliar and alien to him. Shadrach stares in awe at the
immense glaciered peaks, so huge they seem top-heavy, they seem about
to rumble from the sky to crush the bustling city. And is that a
plume of smoke rising from the crest of that most enormous one? He is
not sure. At such a distance&mdash; at least fifty kilometers&mdash;is
it possible to see smoke? Yes. Yes. Beyond any doubt, smoke. He
remembers the last words he heard before the dizziness took him: &quot;It
is the night of Cotopaxi. Red sun, yellow sky.&quot; The great
volcano&mdash;is that it? A flawless cone, swathed in snow and
pumice, its base hidden in clouds, its summit outlined in numbing
majesty against the darkening sky. He has never seen such a mountain.</P>
<P>He halts a boy who darts past him.</P>
<P>&mdash;<I>Por favor.</I></P>
<P>The boy is wide-eyed, terrified, but yet he stops,
looks up.</P>
<P>&mdash;<I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">&iquest;Si,
Se<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">&ntilde;</FONT>or?</FONT></I></P>
<P>&mdash;<I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">&iquest;</FONT>Como

</I>
</P>
<P>Shadrach points toward the colossal snowcapped
volcano. The boy smiles and relaxes. His fear is gone; obviously he
is pleased by the notion of knowing something that this tall
dark-skinned stranger does not. He says: 
</P>
<P>&mdash;<I>Cotopaxi.</I></P>
<P>Cotopaxi. Of course. The transtemporalist has
given him a front row ticket to the great catastrophe. This is the
city of Quito, then, in Ecuador, and that trailing smoke to the
southeast is Cotopaxi, the world's loftiest active volcano, and this
day must be the nineteenth of August, 1991, a day that everyone
remembers, and Shadrach Mordecai knows that before the sun touches
the Pacific tonight the world will be shaken as it rarely has been
shaken in all the time of mankind, and an era will end and a reign of
fire will be loosed upon civilization. And he is the only person on
earth who knows this, and here he stands below great Cotopaxi and he
can do nothing. Nothing. Nothing but watch, and tremble, and perhaps
perish with the half million who will perish here tonight. Can one
die, he wonders, while one is traveling this way? Is it not only a
dream, a dream, a dream, and can dreams kill? Even if he dreams an
eruption, even if he dreams tons of lava and brimstone descending on
his broken body?</P>
<P>The boy is still standing there, staring at him. 
</P>
<P>&mdash;<I>Gracias, amigo. </I>
</P>
<P>&mdash;<I>De nada, se<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">&ntilde;</FONT>or.</I></P>
<P>The boy waits, perhaps for a coin, but Shadrach
has none to give him, and after a moment he runs off, pausing after
ten paces to look back and stick out his tongue, then running again,
sprinting into an alleyway, disappearing.</P>
<P>And a moment later there is a terrible noise from
Cotopaxi and a white column at least a hundred meters thick rises
straight up like a scepter from a secondary cone on the volcano's
sloping flank.</P>
<P>Immediately all movement halts in the city.
Everyone freezes; every head turns toward Cotopaxi. The white column,
pouring from the vent with incredible velocity, rising already to a
height of at least a thousand meters above Cotopaxi's summit, is
spreading now, filling the sky like a broad plume of feathers, a
cloak of live steam. Mordecai perceives a low droning rumbling sound,
as of a train passing through the city, but a train for giants, a
titanic train that makes lanterns sway and potted plants topple from
balconies. The cloud of steam has turned gray on top, with tinges of
red and yellow toward its outer edges.</P>
<P>&mdash;<I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">&iexcl;</FONT>Aie!

<P>And the flight from Quito begins. Nothing has
happened yet, nothing but a roar and a hiss and a column of steam
rushing skyward, but nevertheless the people of the city abandon
their houses, carrying little or nothing, grasping perhaps a crucifix
or a child or a cat or a handful of clothes, crowding into the
streets, shuffling somberly downhill, northward, long lines of people
moving with hunched shoulders, no one looking back, everyone heading
out of the city, heading away from Cotopaxi, from the frightening
crimson cloud that now looms over the mountain, from the death that
soon will come to Quito. These are people wise in the way of
volcanoes, and they do not care to stay for the show. Shadrach
Mordecai is swept along in the human tide. He towers over these folk
as the volcano does over the city, and they glance strangely at him
and some tug at his arms in a kind of appeal, as if they think he is
a black deity come to lead them to safety. But he is leading no one.
He is following, he is fleeing helplessly with all the rest. Unlike
them he does look over his shoulder every few minutes. Whenever he
can, whenever the press of refugees is not too powerful, he pauses
and turns to see what is happening. The volcano now is spurting
little bursts of pumice and light ash, wind-borne powdery stuff that
changes the color of the air, staining it yellow, deepening the sun's
hues to an orange-red. The earth seems to be groaning. The whole city
shakes. Automobiles laden with well-dressed citizens move slowly
through the streets, unable to make headway in the throngs of
shuffling pedestrians; there are collisions, shouts, quarrels. Soon
the cars have halted altogether and their passengers, quirky-lipped
and disdainful, shoulder their way into the lines of humbler folk.
Shadrach has been marching for an hour or two now, perhaps three,
mechanically pushing himself along; the air has grown thin and
chilly, with an acrid reek of brimstone in it, and though it is only
the middle of the afternoon the falling ash has so obscured the light
that the street lamps have come on&mdash; the ash is accumulating
like fine snow in the streets, already ankle-deep&mdash;and still
Cotopaxi roars and hisses, and still the people straggle northward.
Mordecai knows what will happen soon. With the eerie double-edged
vision of the time traveler, he looks forward as well as back,
remembering the future. Before long there will be the explosion that
will be heard thousands of miles away, the earthquake, the clouds of
poisonous gas, the lunatic outpouring of tons of volcanic ash that
will blot out the sun all over the world, and on this night of
Cotopaxi the ancient gods will be let loose on earth and empires will
crumble. He has lived through this night once already, but not with
the knowledge he now has. Somewhere far away at this moment is
fifteen-year-old Shadrach, all arms and legs and huge eyes, doing his
lessons and dreaming of medical school, and he will hear the
explosion too, dull and muffled though it will sound after spanning
the planet from Quito to Philadelphia, and he will think it is a
terrorist's bomb, perhaps, going off downtown, but in the morning he
will see the sky tinted yellow and the swollen sun gone all red, and
then the fine dust will fall for days, bringing early twilights on
these summer evenings, and news will trickle out of South America of
the terrible eruption, the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives.
What that young Shadrach does not know, what no one knows except the
stranger striding through the northern outskirts of Quito under a
dirty crimson cloud, is that the eruption of Cotopaxi is more than a
natural event: it signals a political apocalypse, the fall of the
nations about to begin, the time of Genghis Mao about to arrive. 
</P>
<P>&mdash;<I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">&iexcl;</FONT>El
fin del mundo! </I>
</P>
<P>Yes. Yes. The end of the world. And now the
explosion comes.</P>
<P>It happens in stages, first five quick sharp
reports like cannon-fire; then a long moment of total silence when
even the persistent rumble that has gone on for hours abruptly halts;
then a violent shaking of the earth and a single monstrous booming
sound, the loudest sound Mordecai has ever heard, a sound that breaks
windows and splits walls; then silence again; then the rumbling once
more; then more cannonfire, bang bang bang, quick hard pops; then a
second great boom, five times as powerful as the first, that drops
people to their knees, clutching at their ears; then silence, an
ominous, sinister, nerve-tightening silence; and then the sound of
sounds, the sound of a planet splitting apart at its core, an
unending grotesque avalanche of sound that makes the neck snap and
the arms jerk wildly and the eyes jiggle in then-sockets, a sound
that rolls over Quito like the trampling foot of an angry god. And
the sky turns black and a torrent of red fire spills out of Cotopaxi
and burns with a hideous glare on the horizon. The mountain appears
to be ripping open. Shadrach can see huge chunks of its crest, slabs
of rock that must be the size of great buildings, flying loose and
soaring slowly and grandly toward Quito. The perfect cone, once as
graceful as Mount Fuji's, is a ruin now; a shattered wreck, dimly
visible through the dense clouds of ash and the flying balls of
pumice; it is only a stump, irregular and ghastly. The air itself is
burning. People still struggle onward, moving even more slowly,
dragging themselves along on leaden legs toward a salvation that is
not to be reached, but they vomit, they clutch at their throats, they
gasp, they choke, they fall.</P>
<P>&mdash;<I>Ayuda. Ayuda.</I></P>
<P>But there is no help to be had. They are dying
here in the early afternoon of this sparkling day, sparkling no
longer.</P>
<P>Shadrach, trying to breathe an atmosphere that is
half ash and half carbon monoxide, falls himself, gets up, falls
again, forces himself to rise. He remembers that he is a doctor and
kneels beside a fallen woman, a girl, really, whose face is distorted
and nearly as black as his own from asphyxiation.</P>
<P>&mdash; <I>Yo soy un m<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">&eacute;</FONT>dico.</I></P>
<P>&mdash;<I>Gracias, se<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">&ntilde;</FONT>or.
Gracias.</I></P>
<P>Her eyes flutter. She looks to him for aid,
medicine, a drink of water, anything. How can he help her? He is a
doctor, yes, but can he teach the dying to breathe poisoned air? She
gags, shivers, and then&mdash;strangely&mdash;yawns. She is falling
asleep in his arms. But it is a deadly drowsiness, and she will not
wake. He releases her. He moves onward, handkerchief over his mouth
and nose. Useless. Useless. He falls again and does not rise, he lies
in a heap of weeping murmuring victims, a victim himself. So this is
how it was on the night of Cotopaxi. Night and ash, flight and death.
That saucy boy, those women roasting bits of meat, the shopkeepers
and the bankers, the cab drivers and the policemen, that fall
black-skinned stranger, all dying together now, the hours of frenzied
flight a waste, and Cotopaxi's ashy ejecta filling the heavens,
giving all the world a blood-red twilight. <I>El fin del mundo, </I>yes.
Shadrach claws at the ashes filling his mouth. There is another
explosion, a lesser one now&mdash; for what could equal that last
unimaginable apocalyptic blast?&mdash; and another, another, and he
knows that the booms will continue in diminishing intensity for many
hours, even for days. No one will sleep tonight in Ecuador, in
Colombia, Venezuela, in all of Central America, even in Mexico; the
dread thunder of Cotopaxi will resound in Canada, in Patagonia, it
will reach far across both oceans, and by dawn, the dust-choked dawn,
the black dawn through which no light can penetrate, the first
revolution will be under way, the <I>putsch </I>in Brazil, the
insurrectionists taking advantage of the strange darkness and the
universal terror to launch their long-awaited coup; and then the
chain reaction, the uprisings triggered by the Brazilian one in
Argentina, Nicaragua, Algeria, Indonesia, one bloodbath providing the
cue for the next, and all spurred by Cotopaxi, by the great
symbol-freighted upheaval of the volcano; the economic crises of the
1970s and the repressions and shortages of the impoverished 1980s
leading inexorably to the worldwide chaos of 1991, the global
revolution, the long <I>Walpurgisnacht </I>touched off in some
incalculable way by the eruption.</P>
<P>So this is how it was on the night of Cotopaxi.
The angry gods shaking the world and bringing the nations into
destruction. Shadrach bows his head, closes his eyes, surrenders to
the soft warm fragrant ash that drifts peacefully upon him. This is
the night of Cotopaxi, yes, <I>el fin del mundo, </I>the sounding of
the last trump, the opening of the seventh seal, and he has been part
of it, he has tasted the pumice of the volcano. And now he sleeps.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3>7</H3>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>He stands in the gravel-strewn walk outside the
tent of the transtemporalists, dazed, the sulphurous taste of
Cotopaxi somehow still in his mouth. Nikki has not yet emerged. Other
people he knows wander by, members of Genghis Mao's staff, flowing
past him down the midway toward the garish cluster of gaming
pavilions at the western end of the pleasure complex: there goes
Frank Ficifolia, the jowly little communications man who designed
Surveillance Vector One, and after him a Mongol military
aide-de-camp, Gonchigdorge, all ribbons and medals in his comic-book
uniform, and then two of the Committee vice-chairmen, a pallid Turk
named Eyuboglu and a burly Greek named Ionigylakis. Each, as he
passes, greets Shadrach in characteristic style, Ficifolia warm and
effusive, Gonchigdorge offhanded and remote, Eyuboglu wary,
Ionigylakis boisterous. Shadrach Mordecai manages a nod and a glassy
smile in return, no more. <I>Yo soy un m<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">&eacute;</FONT>dico.
</I>He still feels the earth rumbling. He wishes everyone would let
him alone. In Karakorum one deserves a little privacy. Especially
right now. The significant sectors of his consciousness are still in
the suburbs of Quito, sinking under tons of fine hot ash. Coming out
of transtemporalism is always something of a shock, but this is too
much, it is as bad as eviction from the womb; he is vulnerable and
fuddled, unable to cope with the social rituals. Those rough globules
of airy pumice, that scent of brimstone, that inescapable sleepiness;
above all, that crushing sense of transition, that feeling of one
world falling apart and a new, strange one being formed.&mdash; Out
of the transtemporalists' tent now comes a short pigeon-breasted man
with crooked teeth and astonishing bushy red eyebrows. He is Roger
Buckmaster, British, a microengineering expert, competent and usually
sullen, a man whom few people seem to know well. He plants himself
near the exit of the tent, a few meters from Shadrach Mordecai, and
digs both feet firmly, flatfootedly, into the gravel as though he is
uncertain about his balance. He has the stunned look of a man who has
just been thrown out of a pub after five beers too many.</P>
<P>Mordecai, though he has only a distant
acquaintance with Buckmaster and just now has especially little
interest in a conversation with him, knows all too well how confusing
the first moments outside the tent can be, and is sympathetic. He
feels impelled to meet Buckmaster's wobbly gaze with some sort of
polite gesture; he smiles and says hello, thinking that he will now
retreat into his own confusion and fatigued meditations.</P>
<P>Buckmaster, though, blinks and glares
aggressively. &quot;It's the black bahstard!&quot; he says. His voice
is thick, phlegmy, high-pitched, not at all friendly. &quot;The black
bahstard himself!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Black bahstard?&quot; Mordecai repeats
wonderingly, mimicking the accent, &quot;Black bahstard? Man, did you
call me&mdash;&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Bahstard. Black.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;That's what <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">I</SPAN><I>
</I>thought you said.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Black bahstard. Evil as the ace of spades.&quot;
</P>
<P>This is ludicrous. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Roger, are you all right?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Evil. Black and evil.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I heard you, yes,&quot; Shadrach says. A
miserable throbbing begins along the left side of his skull. He
regrets having acknowledged Buckmaster's presence; he wishes
Buckmaster would disappear. The racial slur itself is more grotesque
than insulting to him, for he has never had any reason to feel
defensive about his color, but he is puzzled by the gratuitousness of
the attack and he remains too deeply under the spell of his own
powerful transtemporal experience to want any sort of interaction
with a truculent clown like Buckmaster, not now, above all not now.
Perhaps the thing to do is ignore him. Shadrach folds his arms and
steps back against a light-pillar.</P>
<P>But Buckmaster says into Shadrach's silence, &quot;You
don't feel covered with shame, Mordecai?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Look, Roger&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Drenched with guilt for every filthy act of
your treacherous life?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Come <I>on. </I>What have you been drinking
in there, man?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;The same as everyone else. Just the drug,
the drug, the time-drug, whatever they give you. D'ye think they fed
me hashish? D'ye think I'm high on whiskey? Oh, no, just the
time-drink, and it opened my eyes, let me tell you, it opened them
wide!&quot; Buckmaster advances until he stands no more man thirty
centimeters from Shadrach Mordecai, glaring up at him, shouting The
pain in Shadrach's skull is that of a spike being hammered deep.
&quot;I've seen Judas sell Him out!&quot; Buckmaster roars. &quot;I
was there, in Jerusalem, at the Supper, watching them eat. Thirteen
at the table, eh? I poured the wine with my own hands, you black
devil, I watched Judas smirking, saw him whispering in His ear, even,
and then out into the garden, y'know. Gethsemane, there in the
darkness&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Would you like a trank, Roger?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Keep off me with your filthy pills!&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;You're getting overwrought. You ought to try
to calm yourself.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Listen to him doctoring me. <I>Me. </I>No,
you won't dope me, and you'll pay heed while I tell you&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Some other time,&quot; Shadrach says. He is
pinned between Buckmaster and the light-pillar, but he slips aside
and makes broad swimming gestures in the air between them, as though
Buckmaster is a noxious vapor he'd like to blow away. &quot;I'm tired
now. I've had a heavy trip in there myself. I can't handle any of
this at the moment, Buckmaster, if you don't mind. All right?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You bloody well will handle it. I saw it,
everything, Judas coming up to Him and kissing Him in the garden, and
saying, Master, master, just as it is in the Book, and then the Roman
soldiers closing in and arresting him&mdash;oh, the bloody betraying
bahstard. I saw it, I was there, I understand now what guilt means.
Do you? You don't. And you're as guilty as he was, in a different way
but the same kind, Mordecai.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I'm a Judas?&quot; Shadrach shakes his head
wearily. Drunks irritate him, even if they are drunk only on the
transtemporalists' drug. &quot;I don't understand any of this. Who is
it I'm supposed to have betrayed?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Everyone. All of mankind.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;And you say you aren't drunk.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Never been more sober. Oh, my eyes are open
now! Who is it who keeps him alive, answer me that? Who's there by
his side, giving him injections, medicines, pills, yelling for the
bloody surgeon every time he needs a new kidney or a new heart, eh?
Eh?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You want the Chairman to die?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Damn right I do!&quot;</P>
<P>Shadrach gasps. Buckmaster has obviously been
driven insane by his transtemporal experience; Shadrach can no longer
be annoyed with him. The angry little man must be protected against
himself. &quot;You'll be arrested if you go on this way,&quot;
Shadrach says. &quot;He might be listening to us right now.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;He's flat on his back, half dead from the
operation,&quot; Buckmaster retorts. &quot;Don't you think I know
that? You put a new liver into him today.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Even so, there are spy-eyes everywhere,
recording instruments&mdash;you designed some of them yourself,
Buckmaster.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I don't care. <I>Let </I>him hear me.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;So now you're a revolutionary?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;My eyes are open. I've had a revelation in
that tent. Guilt, responsibility, evil&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You think the world would be better off with
Genghis Mao dead?&quot;</P>
<P>Fiercely Buckmaster cries, &quot;Yes! Yes! He's
draining us all so he can live forever. He's turned the world into a
madhouse, into a bloody zoo! Look, Mordecai, we could be rebuilding,
we could be passing around the Antidote and healing the whole world,
not just the favored few, we could go back to what we had before the
War, but no, no, we're ruled by a bloody Mongol Khan, can you imagine
that? A hundred-year-old Mongol Khan who wants to live forever! And
he'd have been dead five years ago but for you.&quot;</P>
<P>Shadrach sees where Buckmaster is heading, and he
presses his hands to his temples in dismay. He wants more desperately
than ever to escape from this conversation. Buckmaster is a fool, and
his onslaught is cheap and obvious. Shadrach has thought all this
through, long ago, considered the moral problems, and dismissed them.
Of <I>course </I>serving an evil dictator is wrong. No job for a nice
sincere dedicated black boy from Philadelphia who wants to do good.
But is Genghis Mao evil? Are there any alternatives to his rule,
other than chaos? If Genghis Mao is inevitable, like some natural
force, like the rising of the sun or the falling of the rain, then no
guilt attaches to serving him: one does what seems appropriate, one
lives one's life, one accepts one's karma, and if one is a doctor
then one heals, without considering the ramifications of one's
patient's identity. To Shadrach this is no glib rationalization, but
rather a statement of acceptance of destiny. He refuses to assume
burdens of guilt that have no meaning to him, and he will not let
Buckmaster, of all people, flagellate him over absurdities nor accuse
him of misplacing his loyalties.</P>
<P>He notices that Nikki Crowfoot has come out of the
transtemporalist's tent and is standing to one side, hands on her
hips, waiting for him, and he says to Buckmaster, &quot;Excuse me. I
have to go now.&quot;</P>
<P>Nikki seems transfigured. Her eyes are aglow, her
face glistens with ecstatic sweat, her whole body seems to gleam. As
Shadrach strides toward her, she acknowledges him with a mere tilt of
her head, but she is far away, still lost in her hallucination.</P>
<P>&quot;Let's go,&quot; he says. &quot;Buckmaster's
a little crazy tonight and he's making a nuisance of himself.&quot;</P>
<P>He reaches for her hand.</P>
<P>&quot;Wait!&quot; Buckmaster yells, running toward
them. &quot;I'm not through with you. I've got more to tell you, you
black bahstard!&quot;</P>
<P>Mordecai shrugs and says, ''All right. You can
have one more minute. What do you want me to do, exactly?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Leave off tending him.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I'm a doctor, Buckmaster. He's my patient.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Precisely. And that's why I call you a
guilty bahstard. Billions of people to care for in the world, and
<I>he's </I>the one you choose to look after. Dooming us all to
decades more of Genghis Mao.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Someone else would serve him if I didn't,&quot;
Shadrach says gently. 
</P>
<P>&quot;But you do. <I>You. </I>And I must hold you
responsible.&quot;</P>
<P>Astonished, baffled by the force and persistence
of Buckmaster's attack, Shadrach says, &quot;Responsible for what?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;For the way the world is. The whole bleeding
mess. The continued threat of universal organ-rot twenty years after
the Virus War. The hunger, the poverty. Oh, don't you have any shame,
Mordecai? You with your legs full of machinery that tell you every
twitch of his blood pressure so you can run to him even faster?&quot;</P>
<P>Shadrach glances at Nikki, appealing to her to do
something to rescue him. But she still has that far-off look; she
does not appear to be aware of Buckmaster at all. 
</P>
<P>Angrily Mordecai says, &quot;Who designed that
machinery, Roger?&quot;</P>
<P>Buckmaster recoils. He has been hit where it
hurts. His cheeks blaze; his eyes glisten with furious tears. &quot;I!
I did! You bah-stard, I admit it, I built your dirty implants. Don't
you think I know I share the guilt? Don't you think I understand that
now? But I'm getting out. I won't bear the responsibility any
longer.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;This is suicidal, the way you're carrying
on.&quot; Shadrach Mordecai points to shadowy figures on the
periphery of the path, high staffers who hover in the darkness,
unwilling to come within range of possible spy-eyes while they enjoy
Buckmaster's juicy lunatic outburst. &quot;There'll be a report of
all this on the Chairman's desk tomorrow, Roger, more likely than
not. You're destroying yourself.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I'll destroy <I>him. </I>The bloodsucker. He
holds us all for ransom, our bodies, our souls, he'll let us rot if
we don't serve.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Don't be melodramatic. We serve Genghis Mao
because we have skills and this is the proper place to employ them,&quot;
Mordecai says crisply. &quot;It's no fault of ours that the world is
as it is. If you'd rather have been out in Liverpool or Manchester
living in some stinking cellar with your intestines full of holes,
you could have been.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Don't goad me, Mordecai.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But it's true. We're lucky to be here. We're
doing the only sane thing possible in a crazy world. Guilt is a
luxury we can't afford. You want to walk out now, go ahead, go,
Roger. But you won't want to leave the Khan when you calm down in the
morning.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I refuse to have you patronize me.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'm trying to protect you. I'm trying to get
you to shut up and stop shouting dangerous nonsense.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And I'm trying to get you to pull the plug
and free us from Genghis Khan Mao,&quot; Buckmaster wails, flushed
and wild-eyed.</P>
<P>&quot;So you think we'd be better off without
him?&quot; Shadrach asks. &quot;What are your alternatives,
Buckmaster? What kind of government would you suggest? Come on. I'm
serious. You've been calling me a lot of unpleasant names, now let's
have some rational discussion. You've become a revolutionary, right?
Okay. What's your program? What do you want?&quot;</P>
<P>Buckmaster is beyond the moment for philosophical
discourse, however. He glowers at Mordecai in barely controlled
loathing, framing words that will not leave his throat except as
incoherent guttural growls; he clenches and unclenches his fists, he
sways alarmingly, his reddened cheeks turn scarlet. Shadrach, all
sympathy long gone, turns from him and reaches toward Nikki Crowfoot
again. As they begin to walk away together Buckmaster rushes forward
in a clumsy flailing lunge, clamping his hands on Shadrach's
shoulders and trying to pull him down. Shadrach pivots gracefully,
bends slightly to slip free of Buckmaster's grasp, and, when
Buckmaster hurls himself at him, seizes him about the ribs, spins him
around, and holds him immobile. Buckmaster squirms, kicks, spits,
sputters, but Shadrach is much too strong for him. &quot;Easy,&quot;
Shadrach murmurs. &quot;Easy. Relax. Let go of it, Roger. Let go of
everything.&quot; He holds Buckmaster as one might hold a hysterical
child, until at length he feels Buckmaster go slack, all the frenzy
leaving him. Mordecai releases him and steps back, hands poised at
chest level, ready for a new lunge, but Buckmaster is spent. He backs
away from Mordecai in the slinking heavy-shouldered walk of a beaten
man, pausing after a few paces to scowl and mutter, &quot;All right,
Mordecai. Bahstard. <I>Stay </I>with Genghis Mao. Wipe his decrepit
arse for him. See what happens to you! You'll finish in she furnace,
Shadrach, in the furnace, in the bloody furnace!&quot;</P>
<P>Shadrach laughs. The tension is broken. &quot;The
furnace. I like that. Very literary, Buckmaster.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The furnace for you, Shadrach!&quot;</P>
<P>Mordecai, smiling, takes Crowfoot's arm. She still
looks radiant, ecstatic, lost in transcendental raptures. &quot;Let's
go,&quot; he says. &quot;I can't take any more of this.&quot;</P>
<P>Softly, in a dream-furry voice, she says, &quot;What
did he mean by that, Shadrach? About the furnace?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Biblical reference. Shadrach, Meshach,
Abednego.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Who?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You don't know of it?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No. Shadrach, it's such a lovely night.
Let's go somewhere and make love.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego. In the Book of
Daniel. Three Hebrews who refused to worship Nebuchadnezzar's golden
idol, and the king cast them into a burning fiery furnace, and God
sent an angel to walk with them in there, and they were unharmed.
Strange you don't know the story.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What happened to them?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I told you, love. They were unharmed, not a
hair of their heads singed, and Nebuchadnezzar called them forth, and
told them that their God was a mighty god, and promoted them to high
office in Babylon. Poor Buckmaster. He ought to realize that a
Shadrach wouldn't be afraid of furnaces. Did you have a good trip,
love?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, yes, yes, Shadrach!&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Where did they send you?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Joan of Arc's execution. I watched her
burning, and it was beautiful, the way she smiled, the way she looked
toward heaven.&quot; Nikki presses close against him as they walk.
Her voice still comes to him out of some realm of dream; that bonfire
has left her stoned. &quot;The most inspiring trip I ever had. The
most deeply spiritual. Where can we go now, Shadrach? Where can we be
alone?&quot;</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3>8</H3>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>He is weary of Karakorum after his encounter with
Buckmaster, and he sees now how this whole long day has drained his
vigor and glazed his soul; if he could he would stagger to the
tube-train and let himself be whisked off to Ulan Bator and his
hammock and a night of&mdash;at last&mdash;deep, satisfying sleep.
But Crowfoot, eerily exultant, glows now with insistent lusts, and he
does not feel strong enough to confront her disappointment if he
denies her now. Arm in arm, therefore, they go to the lovers' hospice
at the north end of the pleasure grounds, a bright-skinned
orange-and-green geodesic dome, and with a touch of his thumb against
the credit plate he rents a three-hour room.</P>
<P>Not much of a room. Bed, washstand, clothes rack,
within a little slope-ceilinged segment of the vast dome, annoying
bluish purple granular-finish walls, but the place suffices. It
suffices. Nikki whips off the golden-mesh robe that is her only
garment and from her nude body, four meters away across the room,
comes such a rush of seductive energy, such a flow of force
oscillating cracklingly up and down the whole electroerotic spectrum,
that Shadrach's fatigue is swept away, Cotopaxi and Buckmaster recede
into ancient history, and he swoops joyously toward her. Mouth
seeking mouth, hands rising to breasts. She embraces him, then darts
away, prudently offering her left hip to the contraception next to
the washstand: presses the switch, receives the benevolent bath of
sterilizing soft radiation, and returns to him. The tattooed no-preg
symbol on her tawny flank, a nine-pointed star, glows in brilliant
chartreuse, telling them that the irradiation has done its job. She
strips him and claps hands in glee at the sight of his rigid
maleness. This is not Joan of Arc he is bedding, oh, no; a warrior
perhaps but a maiden no. They tumble to the bed. With hands nearly as
skilled as those of Warhaftig the surgeon, he diligently commences
the customary foreplay, but she lets him know by a quick wordless
flip of her shoulders that he can skip it and get down to the main
event; and he enters the taut hidden harbor between her thighs with a
sudden unsparing thrust that brings grunts of pleasure from them
both. Some things never change. There is a man only four hundred
kilometers to the east who has had four livers and seven kidneys thus
far, and in a tent just a few hundred meters from this bed they sell
a drug that lets one be an eyewitness to the betrayal of the Savior,
and there is a machine in Ulan Bator that flashes instantaneous
pictures of virtually everything that is happening anywhere in the
world, and all of these things would have been deemed miracles only
two generations ago, but nevertheless in this miracle-infested world
of 2012 there have been no significant technological improvements on
the act of love. Oh, there are cunning drugs that are said to enhance
the sensations, and there are clever devices that suppress fertility,
and there are some other little biomechanical gimmicks that the
sophisticated sometimes employ, but all of these are simply updated
versions of peripheral equipment that has been in use since medieval
days. The basic operation has not yet been digitalized or
miniaturized or randomized or otherwise futurized, but remains what
it was in the days of the australopithecines and the
pithecanthropoids; that is, something that mere naked people do,
pressing their humble natural-born bodies one against the other. The
bodies press, copper clasping ebony, acting out the ancient rite,
Shadrach surprising himself with the intensity of his passions. He is
not sure whether this energy comes from Nikki, via some mysterious
telepathic transfer, or from some unexpected reservoir within
himself, but he is grateful for it whatever the source, and rides it
to an agreeable conclusion. Afterward he slips easily into a sound
sleep, awakening only when the mellow but inescapable beeper tone
signals the approaching end of their three-hour rental period. He
finds himself cozily pillowed against Nikki's breasts. She is awake
and evidently has been for sometime, but her smile is beatific and no
doubt she would have cradled him like that all night, an appealing
idea. The night is well-nigh gone, in any case. They allow themselves
a brief cuddle, rise, wash, dress, go forth with hands lightly
touching into the chilly moon-dappled darkness. Like children
unwilling to leave the playground, they drift into a gaming parlor, a
wine house, a light studio, all three packed with raucous
debauched-looking fun-seekers, but they stay no more than a few
minutes in each place, drifting out as aimlessly as they went in, and
finally they admit to each other that they have had enough for one
night. To the tube-train station, then. Dawn will be here soon. From
the ceiling above the station platform dangles a huge glowing green
globe, a public telescreen showing a late-night news program, and
wearily Shadrach peers at it: the face of Mangu looks back at him,
sincere and earnest and deplorably youthful. Mangu is making a
speech, so it seems. Gradually, for he is very tired, Shadrach
perceives that it is the classic Roncevic Antidote speech, the one
which Genghis Mao traditionally makes every five or six months and
which now apparently has been delegated to the heir-apparent. &quot;.
. . major laboratory breakthroughs,&quot; Mangu is saying. &quot;.. .
encouraging progress... fundamental qualitative transformations of
the manufacturing technology ... the unceasing efforts of the
Permanent Revolutionary Committee ... the diligent and persevering
leadership of our beloved Chairman Genghis Mao... there can be no
doubt any longer... large-scale distribution of the drug throughout
the world... the scourge of organ-rot driven from our midst ...
stockpiles increasing daily... a time is approaching when ... a
happy, healthy humanity . . .&quot; 
</P>
<P>A florid, goggle-eyed man standing a few meters
farther down the platform says in a loud harsh whisper to the woman
who accompanies him, &quot;Certainly. In only ninety to one hundred
years.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Quiet, Bel<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">&aacute;</FONT>!&quot;
his companion cries, sounding genuinely alarmed.</P>
<P>&quot;But it is the truth. He lies when he says
the stockpiles are increasing daily. I have seen the figures. I tell
you, I have seen <I>reliable </I>figures.&quot;</P>
<P>Mordecai finds this interesting. The florid man is
Bel&aacute; Horthy, a dour but volatile Hungarian physicist, creator
of the great fusion plant at Bayan Hongor that supplies power for
most of northeastern Asia. He also happens to be minister of
technology for the Permanent Revolutionary Committee, and it is a
little odd to hear so formidably well-connected a government leader
uttering such scandalous subversion in public. Of course, this is
Karakorum, and Horthy, looking boneless and out of focus just now, is
obviously adrift on some potent hallucinogen, but still, but still&mdash;</P>
<P>&quot;The Antidote stockpiles are stable at best,
or even decreasing slightly,&quot; Horthy continues, framing his
words with the exaggerated precision of the extremely intoxicated.
&quot;What Mangu tells us is a lie intended to pacify the populace.
He thinks that telling them such things will make them happy and
induce them to love him. Pfaugh!&quot; The woman tries desperately to
quiet him. She is short and compact, efficiently constructed with her
center of gravity close to the ground; her face is partly obscured by
an ornate, flamboyant green domino, but Shadrach, after a moment,
recognizes her as Donna Labile, no less a mogul than Horthy himself,
in fact minister of demography for the Committee, whose
responsibility it is to maintain a reasonable balance between births
and deaths. Masked or not, it is she, no mistaking that ferocious
jaw, and Shadrach observes that Horthy too has a mask, dangling from
his left hand. Perhaps he thinks he still wears it. She struggles
with him, taking the mask from his limp hand and attempting to fasten
it in place, but be brushes her aside, and, lurching toward Shadrach
Mordecai, greets the doctor with so grandiose a bow that he nearly
pitches himself from the platform. Donna Labile, flapping his
discarded mask about, flutters around him like an angry insect. &quot;Ah,
Dr. Mordecai!&quot; Horthy bellows. &quot;Our leader's devoted
Aesculapius! I greet you!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;... the climax of our unending struggle
against.. .&quot; Mangu says from the glowing globular screen.</P>
<P>Horthy jerks a thumb at the image of the
heir-apparent. &quot;Do you believe that trash, Mordecai?&quot;</P>
<P>Shadrach has his own suspicions about the
sincerity of the Khan's oft-expressed plan for universal distribution
of the Ron-cevic Antidote, but they are suspicions rather less than
half formed, and in any case this is no place to voice them. Softly
he says, &quot;I'm not a member of the Committee, Dr. Horthy. The
only inside information I have concerns such things as the endocrine
balance of Genghis Mao.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But you have an opinion, haven't you?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;My opinion's an uninformed one, and
therefore worthless.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Such a diplomat you are!&quot; Horthy says
in contempt. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Pay no attention,&quot; Donna Labile begs.
&quot;He's had too much tonight. Eating kot and yipka like so much
candy, drugging himself crazy, now risking his whole career&mdash;&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;It seems to be the night for it,&quot;
Shadrach remarks. 
</P>
<P>&quot;A filthy hoax,&quot; Horthy says heavily,
shaking his fist at the screen. He is trembling, ashen-faced beneath
his florid glow, sweating profusely. &quot;Cruel, sinister,
bestial&mdash;'' and he lapses into a series of unintelligible
sibilant expletives, presumably Magyar, toward the end of which he
begins to sob. Donna Labile, meanwhile, has disappeared. After a
moment she returns leading two tall men who wear the gray-and-blue
uniform of the Citizens' Peace Brigade. It is odd to find a couple of
Citpols here, for Shadrach thinks of Karakorum as an open city,
naturally monitored by secret spy-eyes and the usual audio bugs but
otherwise unpoliced; and these two are more man ordinarily repellent
even for Citpols, for they look like identical ugly twins, gray-faced
and gray-eyed, with flat heads and stiff close-cropped hair and
strange malproportioned bodies, all legs and no middle. They walk in
a weird clucking stride, like a couple of poorly programmed robots,
but they appear to be human, more or less: perhaps the Committee,
finding volunteers scarce, is raising a clone of monsters to serve as
policemen. They surround Horthy and speak to him in low, urgent
tones. One of them takes the domino from Donna Labile and with
curiously fussy, almost mincing, gestures, affixes it over the bridge
of Morthy's nose. 
</P>
<P>Then, slipping their arms gently under those of
the minister of technology, they lead him, lifting him a bit so that
his feet are dragging, toward a gray enameled door at the far end of
the platform. Shadrach Mordecai is uncertain whether they are
arresting him at Donna Labile's instigation or&mdash;more likely&mdash;
are hauling him up to some behind-the-scenes sobering-up facility
before he can compromise himself further.</P>
<P>&quot;... a glorious epoch in the splendid history
of the human race ...&quot; Mangu booms.</P>
<P>The tube-train arrives. The survivors of the
night's revelries at Karakorum move slowly, sleepily aboard.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3>9</H3>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Before he heads for his hammock, Shadrach Mordecai
visits the Khan. Though the implants tell him all is well, he feels
obligated after his outing to make a personal call on his patient. It
is early morning, and Genghis Mao lies in blissful sleep: through the
electroencephalographic node in Mordecai's haunch travel the slow
rhythmic quivers of the Chairman's peaceful delta waves. All the
telemetered data reaching Shadrach is encouraging: blood pressure
good, lungs clear of fluid, temperature back to normal, cardiac
activity fine, bile production excellent. The newly installed liver
has obviously established itself already and has begun to undo the
deteriorations of the recent weeks. Shadrach passes through the
interface and enters the bedroom where the Chairman rests within the
intricate cocoon of the intensive-care support system. The biometer
readings on the support system's instrument panel instantly confirm
Shadrach's long-distance diagnosis: the Chairman is doing amazingly
well. None of the emergency equipment has been needed, neither the
oxygen tent nor the electrodialysis machine nor the heart-lung
respirator nor the twelve or fourteen other instruments. There he
lies, relaxed, a faint smile on his thin lips, this man of ninety
years or so, only sixteen hours out of major surgery and already
nearly strong enough to resume the stress of normal life. But of
course there is nothing normal about Genghis Mao's body,
reconstructed so many times out of so many healthy borrowed parts:
like the cannibal chieftain, he has feasted on the flesh of heroes,
and their strength has become his strength. And, Shadrach suspects,
there is some quality of the mind within that tapering triangular
skull that will not admit bodily weakness, that banishes it
altogether from his metabolic cycle. The doctor stands for a few
moments by the bedside, admiring Genghis Mao's toughness of
constitution, half expecting Genghis Mao to wink at him, but the
Khan's sleep holds him utterly.</P>
<P>Off to his own, then. With Genghis Mao in such
fine shape, Shadrach feels free to sleep until sleep is done with
him, even if that is midafternoon. Crowfoot already lies curled and
dozing in his hammock; he strips, snuggles in beside her, delicately
coils his belly and thighs against her back and buttocks, and lets
consciousness go from him.</P>
<P>He is awakened some hours later by an internal
jolt that nearly throws him from the hammock. A geyser of adrenalin
floods his bloodstream; his heart begins to pound, his limbs tremble,
all systems switching on in a violent alarm reaction. Automatically
he begins a process of self-diagnosis, considering and rejecting
within the first fraction of a second such possibilities as a
coronary thrombosis, a cerebral hemorrhage, pulmonary edema; a moment
later, as the thunderous tachycardia begins to subside and his
breathing starts to return to normal, he realizes that it is nothing
more serious than an episode of shock leading into a classic
fight-or-flight syndrome; and an instant after that he becomes aware
that it is all purely vicarious, that there is nothing wrong with him
at all but that he is getting an intense overload via the
telemetering system that links him to Genghis Mao.</P>
<P>He leaps from the hammock, sending it swinging
Wildly. &quot;Shadrach?&quot; Nikki asks, her voice groggy and dim.
&quot;Shadrach, what's happening?&quot;</P>
<P>Catching the hammock for a moment to stabilize it,
he mutters an apology. ''Trouble with the Khan,&quot; he says,
groping along the floor for his casually discarded clothing. He is
fully awake now, but his body is so saturated with the hormonal
outpourings engendered by surprise and alarm that his hands shake and
his jangled mind refuses to focus on the simple tasks of dressing.
Has the Chairman's life-support system malfunctioned? Have assassins
broken into Genghis Mao's bedroom? The Chairman still lives&mdash;the
telemetering leaves no doubt of that&mdash;and whatever it was that
gave Genghis Mao so severe a shock seems already to be over, for his
biophysical output is settling back toward normal, though there are
ample indications of continuing neurasthenic hyperesthesia and
associated cardiovascular and vasomotor distress.</P>
<P>Wearing only his trousers and still feeling
wobbly&mdash;never before, in all the time he has worn the implants,
have the signals from Genghis Mao had such an impact on him&mdash;he
approaches the interface. &quot;Shadrach Mordecai to serve the Khan,&quot;
he says, and waits, and nothing happens for nearly a minute. Dr.
Mordecai repeats the password, more urgently. Still the door remains
shut. &quot;Come on!&quot; he snaps. &quot;The Khan might be dying in
there, and I have to get to him, you idiot machine!&quot; Lights
flash, scanners scan, but nothing else occurs. Shadrach realizes that
the interface system must have gone into emergency mode, under which
the flow of personnel to and from the inner chambers is even more
strictly controlled than usual. This supports the hypothesis of an
assassination attempt. Shadrach shouts, gesticulates, pounds the
interface with his fists, even makes faces at it; but the security
system is obviously concerned with other matters, and it will not let
him in. By the time the door finally does open, he estimates, four or
five minutes have elapsed. The data coming from Genghis Mao holds
firm, at least: the Khan's signals indicate that he is still
disturbed and overexcited but that he is slowly recovering from his
moment of alarm.</P>
<P>Maddeningly, Shadrach is kept another minute or so
in the inner holding chamber; at last it yields, and he lopes swiftly
through Surveillance Vector One, which is deserted, to Genghis Mao's
bedroom. Here the secondary door scanner delays him no more than the
usual microsecond, and he bursts in to find Genghis Mao alive and
awake, sitting up in bed, surrounded by five or six servants and a
dozen or more members of the Committee, all milling about in a
frenzied excitement very much contraindicated at this phase of the
Chairman's recuperation. Mordecai sees General Gonchigdorge,
Vice-Chairman Ionigylakts, Security Chief Avogadro, even Bel&aacute;
Horthy, looking horribly liverish and hung over after his excessive
night in Karakorum. And more people are constantly arriving. Shadrach
is appalled. He can hear the voice of Genghis Mao, clear but weak,
cutting through the overall hubbub, but there is such a mob around
the bed that Mordecai is unable to reach the Khan's side.</P>
<P>&quot;Terrible, terrible,'' Ionigylakis says,
shaking his head from side to side like a wounded bear. 
</P>
<P>Shadrach turns to him. &quot;What's going on?&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;Mangu,&quot; Ionigylakis blurts.
&quot;Assassinated!&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;What? How?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Out the window. Off the balcony.&quot;
Ponderously the big Greek pantomimes the action with great sweeps of
his arm&mdash;the open window, trie draperies fluttering in the
breeze, the curve of The body as it executes its swooping
seventy-five-story descent, the abrupt ghastly termination of the
graceful dive, the hideous impact at plaza level, the tiny final
rebounding motion of the crumpled body.</P>
<P>Shadrach shudders. &quot;When was this?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Ten, fifteen minutes ago. Horthy was just
arriving at the tower. He saw the whole thing.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Who notified the Khan? Horthy?&quot; 
</P>
<P>Ionigylakis shrugs. &quot;How would I know?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;They should have waited. The shock of news
like that&mdash;&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;First I heard of it, I was at my desk in
Committee Vector One and the lights flash emergency mode. Then people
running around everywhere, crazy. Then everyone running in here.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Which is even crazier,&quot; Shadrach says,
scowling. &quot;Making a lot of noise, upsetting the Khan's nervous
system, filling the room with potentially infectious bacteria&mdash;doesn't
anyone have any sense? We're jeopardizing his life in this chaos.
Help me clear the room.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But the Khan has sent for these people!&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;Doesn't matter. He doesn't need tham all.
I'm responsible for his health, and I want everybody out of here
except, oh, Avogadro and Gonchigdorge and maybe Eyuboglu.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;But&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No buts. The rest of you ought to return to
Committee Vector One so you can handle more trouble if more trouble
comes. What if this is the start of a worldwide revolutionary
uprising? Who's going to face the crisis if you're all in here? Go.</P>
<P>&quot;Go. I want to clear the room. Get everybody
out, will you? That's an order.&quot;</P>
<P>Ionigylakis still looks doubtful, but after a
moment's hesitation he nods and begins pushing people
enthusiastically toward the door, bellowing at them that they must
leave, while Shadrach, catching the attention of the security chief,
tells him to post his men in the hall to keep visitors out.</P>
<P>Shadrach approaches the bed. Genghis Mao looks
drawn and tense, his forehead moist, shiny, his skin tone pallid and
grayish. He is breathing shallowly and his eyes, always restless,
move now with manic intensity. The life-support system has activated
itself and is feeding the Khan a steady flow of glucose, sodium
chloride, and blood plasma; Shadrach, glancing quickly at the
readings on the instrument panel and integrating them with his own
telemetered inputs, assesses Genghis Mao's level of blood potassium
and plasma magnesium, his capillary permeability, his arteriolar
vasoconstriction, and his venous pressure, and makes manual
adjustments in the rate of medication. &quot;Try to relax,&quot; he
tells Genghis Mao. &quot;Sit back. Let your limbs go limp.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;They killed him,&quot; the Khan says
hoarsely. &quot;Have you heard? They threw him from his window.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes. I know. Lie back, please, sir.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The killers must still be somewhere inside
this building. I'll supervise the investigation myself. Wheel me into
Surveillance Vector One, Shadrach.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That won't be possible. You'll have to
remain here, sir.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Don't talk that way to me. Avogadro!
Avogadro! Help me into the wheelchair!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I'm sorry, sir,&quot; Shadrach murmurs,
signaling frantically behind his back to Avogadro to ignore the
command of Genghis Mao. At the same time Shadrach nudges a pedal that
sends a flow of tranquilizing 9-pordenone into the Chairman's body.
&quot;It could be fatal for you to leave the bed now, sir. Do you
understand me? It could kill you.&quot;</P>
<P>Genghis Mao understands that. He sinks back
against the pillow, looking almost relieved at being overruled, and
as the drug takes effect his face relaxes, his demeanor becomes far
less intense. Genghis Mao is much weaker, Shadrach realizes, than the
instruments indicate. &quot;They killed him,&quot; the Khan says
again, ruminatingly, absent-voicedly. &quot;Only a boy and they
killed him. He had no enemies.&quot; And to Shadrach's amazement the
old man's lips begin to quiver and his eyes fill with tears, Eh?
What's this? A show of some genuine emotion by Genghis Mao? A kind of
quasi-paternal grief seizing the old man? But how can that be,
considering the bleak fate Genghis Mao had himself intended for
Mangu? Either yesterday's surgery has so enfeebled the Khan that he
has grown uncharacteristically sentimental, suddenly entering an
inconceivable dotage, or else Mordecai is misreading the signs: not
grief but fear, cognizance of personal peril, awareness that if
assassins could reach Mangu they might well find a way into the
sanctum of Genghis Mao. That must be it. The Khan is angry and
afraid, but because he is so diminished physically by his operation,
his anger and fear momentarily take the form of sorrow. And indeed,
after a few moments more Genghis Mao grows calm again, and says, in a
low, controlled, newly resonant voice. &quot;This is the first
successful attack against our rule that we have experienced. It is
unprecedented and must be met with force to demonstrate that we have
lost none of our vigor and that our authority will not be
undermined.&quot; He beckons Avogadro to his bedside and begins to
dictate plans for mass arrests, wholesale interrogation of suspected
subversives, tightened security measures both within the Grand Tower
and in Ulan Bator in general. He sounds now less like a bereaved
elder than a threatened despot. The loss of Mangu, it quickly becomes
clear, means little or nothing to him personally, Mangu having been
such a cipher, but it is a frightening omen of a breach in the power
of his regime, and will require a reign of terror.</P>
<P>In the midst of these grim plans Genghis Mao
suddenly looks up at Shadrach as if noticing him for the first time
that morning, and says amiably, &quot;You have nothing on but your
trousers, Doctor. Why is that?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I came here in a hurry. I got a tremendous
jolt from the implants, strong enough to wake me up, and I knew there
must be trouble.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes. When Horthy brought me news of the
assassination I became quite agitated.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Your damned doors kept me waiting for five
minutes, though. We ought to do something about that. Someday it'll
be a critical matter for me to get to you in time, and Interface
Three will give me the business again and it'll be too late.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Mmm. We'll talk about that.&quot; The Khan
eyes Shadrach's bare torso with some amusement and, it would seem,
admiration, surveying the pronounced ridges of muscle down his belly,
the long lean arms, the wide powerful shoulders. It is a pleasing
body, Shadrach knows, trim and shapely and covered all over with
smooth lovely chocolate skin, an athletic and graceful body, not much
changed from the days nearly twenty years ago when he was a
respectable college sprinter and passable basketball player, but
nevertheless there is something weird and unnerving about this close
inspection. After a moment the Khan says, sounding almost jolly, &quot;You
look very healthy, Shadrach.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I try to keep in shape, sir.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;A wise doctor you are. So many of your
profession worry about everyone's health except their own. But why
were you still in bed at this hour of the morning?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I was in Karakorum late last night,&quot;
Shadrach confesses.</P>
<P>Genghis Mao laughs explosively. &quot;Dissipation!
Debauchery! So that's how you keep in shape, is it?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;At ease. I'm not serious.&quot; The
Chairman's mood has changed astonishingly in these few minutes. This
badgering banter, this light teasing&mdash;it is hard to believe that
he was weeping for dead Mangu just a moment ago. &quot;You can go and
get your shirt, if you like. I think I can spare you for a few
minutes, Shadrach.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I'd prefer to stay a while longer, sir. It's
not chilly this way.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;As you wish.&quot; Genghis Mao seems to lose
interest in him. He turns back to Avogadro, still waiting by the
bedside, and rattles off half a dozen more repressive measures to be
put into effect at once. Then, dismissing the security chief, the
Chairman summons Vice-Chairman Eyuboglu and outlines, seemingly
impromptu, an elaborate program for the virtual canonization of
Mangu: a colossal state funeral, a prolonged period of global
mourning, the renaming of highways and cities, the erection of costly
and imposing memorial monuments in every major capital. All this for
such a trifling boy? Why? Shadrach wonders. This is an outpouring of
mortuary energy worthy of a demigod, an Augustus Caesar, a Siegfried,
even an Osiris. Why? Why, if not that Mangu was a symbolic extension
of Genghis Mao himself, his link to tomorrow, his hope of bodily
reincarnation? Yes, Shadrach decides. In ordering this bizarrely
inappropriate posthumous inflation of the murdered man, Genghis Mao
must be mourning not Mangu but himself.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3><I>10</I></H3>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Was Mango really murdered, though? Avogadro,
waiting for Mordecai in the hallway when the doctor finally leaves
Genghis Mao, is not so sure of that. The security chief, a big-boned,
thick-bodied, quick-witted man with cool eyes and a wide, quizzical
mouth, draws Shadrach aside near the entrance to Surveillance Vector
One and says softly. &quot;Is he on any medication that might be
making him mentally unstable?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Not particularly. Why?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I've never seen him as upset as this
before.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;He's never had his viceroy assassinated
before, either.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;What leads you to think there's been an
assassination?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Because I&mdash;because Ionigylakis
said&mdash;because&mdash;&quot; Shadrach pauses, confused. &quot;Wasn't
there one?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Who knows? Horthy says he saw Mangu fall out
the window. Period. He didn't see anyone pushing him. We've already
run playback checks on all personnel scanners and there's no record
of any unauthorized individual entering or leaving the entire
building this morning, let alone having reached the seventy-fifth
floor.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Perhaps somebody was hiding up here
overnight,&quot; Shadrach suggests.</P>
<P>Avogadro sighs. He looks faintly amused. &quot;Spare
me the amateur detective work. Doctor. Naturally, we've looked
through yesterday's records too.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'm sorry if I&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I didn't mean to be sarcastic. My point is
simply that we've considered most of the obvious possibilities. It's
not easy for an assassin to get inside this building, and I don't
seriously believe that any assassins did. Naturally, that doesn't
rule out the chance that Mangu was pushed by someone whose presence
within the building would not seem unusual, as for example General
Gonchigdorge, or you, or me&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Or Genghis Mao,&quot; Shadrach offers.
&quot;Tiptoeing from his bed and tossing Mangu through the window.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You get the idea. What I'm saying is that
anyone up here might have killed Mangu. Except that there's no
evidence that anyone did. You know, whenever someone passes through a
door up here, it's recorded. No one entered Mangu's bedroom this
morning, either on the interface side or the elevator side. The
tracking cores are absolutely blank. The last one to go in was Mangu
himself, about midnight. Preliminary inspection indicates no traces
of intruders in the room, no strange fingerprints, no flecks of
someone else's dandruff, no stray hairs, no bits of lint. And no sign
of a struggle. Mangu was a strong man, you know. He wouldn't have
been easy to overpower.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You're suggesting it was probably suicide?&quot;
Shadrach asks.</P>
<P>&quot;I am. Obviously. No one on my staff takes
any other theory at all seriously at this point. But the Chairman is
certain it was an assassination, and you should have seen him before
you got here. Almost hysterical, wild-eyed, raving. You know, it
doesn't look good for me and my men if he believes there's been an
assassination. We're supposed to make assassinations impossible up
here. But it goes beyond whether I lose my job, Doctor. There's this
whole fantastic purge that he's instituting, the arrests, the
interrogations, restrictive measures, a tremendously messy and
unpleasant and expensive enterprise, all of it, so far as I can see,
absolutely useless. What I want to know,&quot; Avogadro says, &quot;is
whether you think there's some chance the Chairman will be willing to
take a more rational attitude toward Mangu's death when he's further
along in his recovery.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I don't know. But I don't think so. I've
never seen him change his mind about anything.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But the operation&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Has weakened him, sure. Physically <I>and
</I>psychologically. But it hasn't greatly affected his reason in any
way that I can perceive. He's always had this thing about assassins,
of course, and obviously he's assuming Mangu was murdered because it
fulfills some kind of inner need for him, some fantasy projection,
something very dark and intricate. I think he'd have made the same
assumption even if he'd been in perfect health when Mangu went out
the window. So his recovery <I>per se </I>isn't going to be a factor
in getting him to reevaluate Mangu's death. All I can suggest is that
you wait three or four days until he's strong enough to be getting
back on the job and go in there with the findings of your completed
investigation, show him conclusively that there's no evidence
whatsoever of murder, and count on his basic sanity to bring him to
an acceptance of the fact that Mangu killed himself.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Suppose I bring him the report this
afternoon?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;He's not really ready for all this stress.
Besides, is such a speedy investigation going to be plausible to him?
No, I'd recommend waiting at least three days, preferably four or
five.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And meanwhile,&quot; Avogadro says,
&quot;suspects will be rounded up, minds will be pried into, the
innocent will suffer, my staff will be wasting its energies on a
foolish pursuit of a nonexistent assassin&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Can't you delay the purge a few days, then?&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;He ordered us to start at once, Doctor.&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, I know, but&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;He ordered us to start at once. We've done
so.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Already?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Already. I understand the meaning of an
order from the Chairman. Within the past ten minutes the first
arrests have taken place. I can try to stretch out the process of
interrogation so that as little harm as possible will come to the
prisoners before I can bring my findings on Mangu's death to the
Chairman, but I have no authority to sidetrack his instructions
altogether.&quot; Quietly Avogadro adds, &quot;I wouldn't want to
risk it, either.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Then there'll be a purge,&quot; Shadrach
says, shrugging. &quot;I regret that as much as you do, I suppose.
But there's no way to stop it now, eh? And no real hope that you'll
persuade Genghis Mao to swallow the suicide theory, not this
afternoon or tomorrow or next week, not if he wants to think Mangu
was murdered. I'm sorry.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I am also,&quot; Avogadro says. &quot;Well.
Thanks for your time, Doctor.&quot; He begins to move away; then,
pausing, he gives Shadrach a deep, uncomfortably appraising look, and
says, &quot;Oh, one more thing. Doctor. Is there any reason you might
know of for Mangu to have wanted to kill himself?&quot; Shadrach
frowns. He considers things.</P>
<P>&quot;No,&quot; he answers after a moment. &quot;No.
Not that I'm aware of.&quot;</P>
<P>He goes on into Surveillance Vector One. The big
room is crowded with high staff personnel. He begins to feel a little
odd, wandering around headquarters without a shirt. General
Gonchigdorge sits at Genghis Mao's ornate throne, jabbing with stubby
fingers at the enormous keyboard that controls the whole vast spy-eye
apparatus. As the general pounds the buttons, images of life out
there in the Trauma Ward swing jerkily in and out of focus, zooming
into view and vanishing rapidly. The scene on the screens looks just
as dizzyingly random as when the machine is left to its own whims;
not surprising, for Gonchigdorge really does seem to be tapping the
keys without system, without purpose, in a kind of sullen petulance,
as though he hopes to uncover a revolutionary cadre ouf there by some
stochastic process of nondirected scoops&mdash;dipping down into the
world here and there until he comes upon a band of desperados waving
a banner, we are conspirators. But the screens reveal only the usual
human story, people working, walking, suffering, quarreling, dying.</P>
<P>Horthy, appearing silently at Mordecai's left
elbow, says, with a certain glee, &quot;The arrests have already
begun.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I know. Avogadro told me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Did he tell you that they have a prime
suspect?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Who?&quot;</P>
<P>Horthy delicately prods his thumbs into the
corners of his bulging, bloodshot eyes. A psychedelic effluvium still
hovers about him. &quot;Roger Buckmaster,&quot; he says. &quot;The
microengineering man, you know.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes. I know. I've worked with him.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Buckmaster was heard making wild statements
at Karakorum last night,&quot; Horthy says. &quot;Calling for the
overthrow of Genghis Mao, yelling subversion at the top of his lungs.
The Citpols picked him up, finally, but they decided he was just
drunk and let him go.&quot;</P>
<P>In a low voice Shadrach says, &quot;Is that what
happened to you?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Me? To me? I don't understand what you
mean.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;At the tube-train station. I saw you there,
remember? While they were running the tape of Mangu's speech. You
made some remarks about the Antidote distribution program, and then
the Citpols&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No,&quot; Horthy says. &quot;You must be
mistaken.&quot; His eyes fix on Shadrach's and lock there. They are
intimidating eyes, cold and hostile, despite all their dissipated
bleariness. With great precision Horthy says, &quot;It was someone
else you saw at Karakorum, Dr. Mordecai.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;You weren't there last night?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;It was someone else.&quot;</P>
<P>Shadrach chooses to take the crude hint, and
decides not to press the issue. &quot;My apologies. Tell me about
Buckmaster. Why do they think he's the one?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;His eccentric behavior last night was
suspicious.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Is that all?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You'll have to ask the security people for
the rest.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Was he found near Mangu's apartment at the
time of the murder?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I couldn't say. Dr. Mordecai.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;All right.&quot; On the surveillance
screens, in repellent close-up, the image of a girl vomiting. It is
the crimson puke of organ-rot, in glistening lifelike color. Horthy
seems almost to smile at the sight, as though nothing horrid is alien
to him. Shadrach says, &quot;One more thing. You saw Mangu fall,
didn't you?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And then you notified Genghis Mao?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I notified the guards in the lobby first.&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;Of course.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And then I went to the seventy-fifth floor.
The security people had already sealed it, but I was able to enter.&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;Going straight to the Chairman's bedroom?&quot;
</P>
<P>Horthy nods. &quot;Which was under triple guard. I
obtained admittance only by insisting on my ministerial privileges.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Was Genghis Mao awake?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes. Reading PRC reports.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What would you say was his general state of
health?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Quite good. He looked pale and weak, but not
unusually so, considering that he had just had a major operation. He
greeted me and saw from my expression that something was wrong, and
asked me, and I told him what had happened.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Which was?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What else?&quot; Horthy says snappishly.
&quot;That Mangu had fallen from his window, naturally.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Is that how you put it? 'Mangu has fallen
from his window'?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Something like that.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Did you talk about his being pushed, maybe?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why are you interrogating me. Dr. Mordecai?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Please. This is important. I need to know
whether the Khan arrived at the idea that Mangu was assassinated by
himself, or if you inadvertently put the suggestion in his mind.&quot;</P>
<P>Horthy stares balefully up at Shadrach Mordecai.
&quot;I told him exactly what I saw: Mangu falling from the window. I
drew no conclusions about how it had happened. Even if someone had
thrown him, how much could I have seen, four hundred meters below? At
that distance Mangu himself was no bigger man a speck against the
sky, a doll. I didn't recognize him until he had nearly reached the
ground.&quot; A disconcerting gleam appears in Horthy's eyes. He
leans close to Shadrach and says, almost crooning, &quot;He looked so
serene. Dr. Mordecai! Floating there above me&mdash;his eyes wide
open, his hair straight out behindhim, his lips drawn back&mdash;he
was smiling, I think. Smiling! And then he hit.&quot;</P>
<P>Ionigylakis, who has evidently been eavesdropping,
interjects abruptly, &quot;That's strange. If someone had just flung
him from the window, would he have looked so cheerful?&quot;</P>
<P>Shadrach shakes his head. &quot;I doubt that Mangu
was conscious at all by the time Horthy could see his face. That
serene expression was probably just acceleration stupor.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Perhaps,&quot; Horthy says crisply.</P>
<P>&quot;Go on,&quot; Shadrach tells him. &quot;You
informed the Khan that Mangu had fallen. Then what happened?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;He sat up so sharply that I thought he would
break the medical machinery all around him. He turned red in the face
and began to perspire. His breath came in gasps. Oh, it was very bad,
Dr. Mordecai. I thought he would die from overexcitement. He started
to wave his arms, to shout about assassins&mdash;suddenly he sank
back against the pillow, he put his hands to his chest&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You thought he would die from
overexcitement,&quot; Shadrach says. &quot;But it never occurred to
you beforehand that it might be unwise to trouble him with news like
that, in his state of health.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;One doesn't think clearly at a time like
that.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;One ought to, if one is in a position of
high responsibility,&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;One's judgment is not always perfect,&quot;
Horthy retorts. &quot;Especially when one has nearly been killed
oneself a few minutes before by a body plummeting from the sky. And
when one realizes that the dead man is such an important figure in
the government, in fact the viceroy. And when one suspects that his
death may be murder, assassination, the beginning of revolution. And
when&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;All right,&quot; Shadrach says. &quot;All
right. He managed to survive the unnecessary shock. But what you did
was very risky, Horthy. Worse: it was dumb. Extremely dumb.&quot; He
frowns. &quot;You think there's some conspiracy, eh?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I have no idea. Clearly it's a possibility.&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;So is suicide, though.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Ionigylakis says, &quot;You think so, Shadrach?&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;Avogadro certainly does.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;But Avogadro's men have arrested
Buckmaster.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I've heard. The poor crazy devil. I pity
him.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Gonchigdorge is still jabbing buttons. The screens
are full of weirdly distorted faces, as though the spy-eye lenses are
getting much too close to their targets. Donna Labile, from the far
side of the room, calls to Horthy, who gives Shadrach a frosty
incomprehensible look and stalks away. Shadrach is altogether unable
to make sense out of Horthy, but suddenly it does not matter. Nothing
matters. This room is a madhouse, through which he wanders,
bare-chested and feeling a bit of a chill, baffled by all the frantic
activity around him. He feels too sane, too mundane, for this
environment. The screens of Surveillance Vector One suddenly go
blank, and then grow bright with wild jagged streaks of blue and
green and red. General Gonchigdorge, in his heavy-handed pursuit of
conspirators, has broken something.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Fricifolia!&quot; the general yells. &quot;Get
Frank Ficifolia up here! The machine has to be repaired!&quot;</P>
<P>Ficifolia is already present, though. Cursing
softly, he shoulders through the crowd toward the enthroned general.
As he passes Shadrach he pauses to murmur, &quot;Your friend
Buckmaster's in the quiz room right now. I suppose you won't weep
over that.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;On the contrary. Buckmaster wasn't in his
right mind when he was hassling me last night. And now he'll pay for
it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Avogadro himself is interrogating, I hear.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Avogadro thinks it was suicide.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;So do I,&quot; Ficifolia says, and keeps
going.</P>
<P>Shadrach has had enough. He heads for the
interface. As he reaches it, he looks back at the turmoil, the
blaring jags of color on the screens, Gonchigdorge shouting like an
angry child, Horthy and Labile deep in some mysterious intense
discussion punctuated by fierce Italo-Magyar gesticulations,
Ionigylakis looming above everyone and announcing his confusions in
booming tones, Frank Ficifolia squatting by an open panel to insert a
long slender wrench into a turbulent spaghetti of bubble-circuits.
While somewhere in the depths of this huge building Avogadro, who
does not believe a murder was committed, is nevertheless preparing to
administer torture to Roger Buckmaster, suspected of having committed
that murder, even though Buckmaster almost certainly could not have
been capable of murdering anyone this morning. And in the great
bedchamber of the Khan that old, old man, his near-fatal episode of
shock all but over according to the tickety-tock pulsations and
quivers running through Shadrach Mordecai's body, lies in bed
scheming with calm crazy dedication how best to make sacred the
memory of the departed viceroy and how to destroy his supposed
slayers. Enough, enough. More than enough: too much. Shadrach
requests exit from the interface, which opens with blessed promptness
and admits him to the holding chamber, and then, quickly, to his own
apartment on the far side.</P>
<P>How peaceful it is here! Crowfoot is awake and out
of the hammock; she has just taken a shower, and stands, bare,
beautiful, in the middle of the room, drying herself, droplets of
moisture still glittering on her smooth sleek skin, nipples puckered
and taut in the coolness of the air. &quot;I'm going to be awfully
late getting to the lab today,&quot; she says casually. &quot;What's
been happening?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Everything. Mangu's dead, the Khan nearly
had apoplexy when he found out, they've arrested Buckmaster, a
general purge of subversives has been ordered, Horthy is&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Wait,&quot; she cries, blinking. &quot;Dead?
Mangu? How?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Fell out the window. Pushed or jumped.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh.&quot; A little sucking intake of breath.
&quot;Oh, God. When was this?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Half an hour ago, more or less.&quot; 
</P>
<P>She crumples her towel into a ball, hurls it into
a corner, and begins to pace the room, striding like a splendid
perplexed tigress. Whirling on him, she demands, &quot;Which window?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;His own,&quot; he tells her, mystified by
the drift of her question.</P>
<P>&quot;Fell from the top of the building? His body
must have been smashed to a ruin.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I imagine so. But what&mdash;&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, Shadrach! My project!&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;What about it?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;This sounds terribly inhuman, doesn't it?
But what will happen to my project now? Without Mangu&mdash;&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Oh,&quot; he says dully. &quot;I hadn't
considered that.&quot; &quot;He was intended for&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes. Don't say it.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's awful of me to have that reaction.&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;Was the entire project built about Mangu as
the specific particular one&mdash;the recipient?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Not necessarily. But&mdash;oh, to hell with
the project!&quot; She crouches near the floor, folding her arms
across her breasts. She is shivering. &quot;I don't understand. Who
would kill Mangu, anyway? What's going on? Is there going to be a
revolution, Shadrach?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Mangu may have killed Mangu,&quot; he tells
her. &quot;No one knows yet. Avogadro's men didn't detect any sign of
forced entry to his apartment.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yet they've arrested Buckmaster?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Because of the nonsense he was spouting last
night in Karakorum, I suppose. But they haven't arrested Horthy, who
was being just as subversive. Horthy's right next door in
Surveillance Vector One, He was the one who brought the news about
Mangu to Genghis Mao. Damn near killed him with the shock of it.&quot;</P>
<P>Nikki, looking up somberly, says, &quot;Perhaps
that's what he wanted to do.&quot;</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3><I>11</I></H3>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Things grow calmer. The messages from the interior
of Genghis Mao indicate that the medical crisis is past. The Khan is
healing, the morning's upheavals will have no serious impact. Here at
noon, Shadrach Mordecai at last dresses for the day, neutral gray
doctor's clothes. He feels rootless, disoriented: too much sleep,
after all these months of insomnia, the nap in Nikki's arms in
Karakorum and then the long, emergency-interrupted spell in the
hammock, and now his mind is foggy. But he'll fake it through the
day, somehow.</P>
<P>Heading for his office, he passes as usual through
Surveillance Vector One, much quieter now than it was fifteen or
twenty minutes before. The high panjandrums are gone, Gonchigdorge
and Horthy and Labile and that crowd, and no one remains, except
three underlings, a Citpol man and a couple of Avogadro's
lieutenants, who stare moodily at the jumpy mosaic flitting across
the hundreds of screens. Their eyes are glazed. Informational
overkill, it is. They see so much that they know not what they see.</P>
<P>Bypassing Committee Vector One&mdash;Shadrach has
no yearning to intrude on the politicos this tense morning&mdash;he
takes the long route to his office, via Genghis Mao's own vacant
office and the Khan's majestic dining room. It is, as always,
comforting to be among his familiar talismans, his books, his
collection of medical instruments. He wanders from case to case,
getting himself together. Picks up his devaricator, sinister
splay-elbowed forceps used to pry open wounds. Thinks of Mangu,
splattered against the terrazzo pavement; banishes the thought.
Examines the hacksaw with which some eighteenth-century surgeon
accomplished amputations. Thinks of Genghis Mao, livid, beady-eyed,
ordering mass arrests. <I>Off with their heads! </I>That may be next;
why not? Fondles a fifteenth-century anatomical doll from Bologna,
elegant ivory homunculus, female&mdash; what is the feminine of
homunculus, he wonders? Homuncula? Feminacula?&mdash;the belly and
breasts of which lift away at the push of a fingertip, revealing
heart, lungs, abdominal organs, even a fetus crouching in the uterus
like a kangaroo in the pouch. And the books, oh, yes, the precious
musty books, formerly _ owned by great doctors of Vienna, Montreal,
Savannah, New Orleans. Valesco de Tarania's <I>Philonium
Pharmaceutieum et Cheirurgicum, </I>1599! Martin Schurig's
<I>Gynaecologia Historico Medica, </I>1730, rich with details of
defloration, debauchery, penis captivus, and other wonders! Here is
old Rudolf Virchow's <I>Die Cellularpathologie, </I>1852, proclaiming
that every living organism is &quot;a cell state in which every state
is a citizen,&quot; that a disease is &quot;a conflict of citizens in
this state, brought about by the action of external forces.&quot; <I>Aux
armes, citoyens! </I>What would Virchow have said of transplanted
livers, borrowed lungs? He'd call them hired mercenaries, no doubt:
the Hessians of medical metaphor. At least they fight fair in the
cellular wars, no sneaky defenestrations, no snipers on the overpass.
And this huge book: Grootdoorn, <I>Iconographies Medicalis, </I>luscious
old engravings&mdash;see, here. Saints Cosmas and Damian in the
sixteenth-century portrait, shown grafting the dead Moor's leg to the
cancer victim's stump. Prophetic. Transplant surgery circa 500 A.D.,
performed posthumously, no less, by the saintly surgeons. If I ever
find the original of that print, Shadrach thinks, I'll give it to
Warhaftig for Hanukkah.</P>
<P>He spends half an hour updating Genghis Mao's
medical file, dictating a report on the liver operation, adding a
postscript about this morning's brief alarm. Someday the printout of
the Genghis Mao dossier is going to be a medical classic, ranking
with the Smith Papyrus and the <I>Fabrica, </I>and he toils
conscientiously over it, preparing his place in the history of his
art. Just as he finishes the account of the current episode, Katya
Lindman phones him.</P>
<P>&quot;Can you come down to the Talos lab?&quot;
she asks. &quot;I'd like to show you our latest mock-up.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I suppose so. You've heard about Mangu?&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;Of course.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You don't sound very concerned.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;What was Mangu? Mangu was an absence. Now
the absence is absent. His death was more of an event than his whole
existence.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I doubt that he saw things that way
himself.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You are so compassionate, Shadrach,&quot;
she says in the flat voice that he knows she reserves for mockery. &quot;I
wish I shared your love of mankind.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I'll see you in fifteen minutes, Katya.&quot;</P>
<P>Her laboratory is on the ninth floor of the Grand
Tower, a cluttered place festooned with cables, connectors, buses,
coaxials, crates of bubble-chips, enough electronic gear to throttle
a brontosaur. Out of this chaotic maze of materiel Lindman
materializes, coming toward him in her customary slashing headlong
stride. She is all business, very much the bustling woman of science.
She wears a white blouse, a lavender lab jacket open at the throat, a
short brown tweed skirt. The effect is severe, stark, and harsh,
mitigated neither by the bare thighs nor the tightness of the skirt
nor the exposed cleft of her breasts. Lindman is not a woman who
works at projecting sexuality. Nor does she need to, with Shadrach;
she holds a malign physical authority over him, the source of which
he does not comprehend. He feels always when he is with her that he
must be on guard&mdash; against what, he is not sure.</P>
<P>&quot;Look,&quot; she says triumphantly, with a
broad sweeping gesture.</P>
<P>He follows her pointing arm halfway across the
laboratory to the one uncluttered place, a kind of dais, on which,
under a dazzling spotlight, the current working model of the Genghis
Mao automaton sits enthroned. A single thick yellow-and-red cable
runs to it from a power unit. The automaton is half again as large as
life, a massive imitation of the Chairman, plastic skin over metal
armature; the face is an altogether convincing replica, the shoulders
and chest look plausibly human, but below the diaphragm the robot
Genghis Mao is an incomplete thing of struts and wires and bare
circuitry, skinless and lacking even the internal mechanical
musculature that fills its upper half. As Shadrach watches, the
ersatz Chairman extends its right arm toward him and, with an
altogether human impatient little flip of its hand, beckons him
forward. &quot;Go ahead,&quot; Katya Lindman says. He advances. When
he is three or four meters away he halts and waits. The robot's head
slowly turns to face him. The lips pull back in a cruel grimace&mdash;no,
a grin, unmistakably a grin, the bleak and terrible grin of Genghis
Mao, that self-congratulatory smirk, slowly forming at the corners of
the leathery cheeks, a regal grin, a monstrous overbearing grin.
Imperceptibly the features rearrange themselves, without apparent
transition; the robot now is scowling, and the wrath of Genghis Mao
darkens the room. <I>Off with their heads, </I>yes, indeed. And then
a smile. A cold one, for there is no other sort from Genghis Mao, but
yet it is a smile that puts one at one's ease, Arctic though it is;
and the smile of the robot is an uncanny replica of the smile of
Genghis Mao. And, lastly, the wink, the famous wink of the Khan, that
sly, disarming dip of the eyelid that cancels all the seeming
ferocity, that communicates a redeeming sense of perspective, of
self-appraisal: <I>Don't take me so seriously, friend, I may not be
the megalomaniac you think I am. </I>And then, just as the wink has
achieved its effect and the terror that Genghis Mao can generate with
a glance has subsided, the face returns to its original expression,
icy, remote, alien. &quot;Well?&quot; Lindman asks, after some while.
</P>
<P>&quot;Doesn't he speak?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Not yet. The audio is trivial <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">to</SPAN><I>
</I>accomplish. We aren't bothering with it just now.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;That's the whole show, then?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;That's it. You sound disappointed.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Somehow I expected more. I've seen him do
the grin already.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But not the wink. The wink is new.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Even so, Katya&mdash;you add a feather here
and there, but you still don't have an eagle.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What did you think I'd show you? A walking,
talking Genghis Mao? The complete simulacrum overnight?&quot; His
disappointment has angered her, obviously: her mouth works tensely,
the lips drawing back from the gums again and again, baring those
pointed carnivorous incisors. &quot;We still are in preliminary
stages here. But I thought you would like the wink. I like the wink.
I rather do like the wink, Shadrach.&quot; Her voice grows lighter,
her features soften; he can almost hear the gears shifting within
her. &quot;I'm sorry I wasted your time. I was pleased with the wink.
I wanted to share it with you.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's a fantastic wink, Katya.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And, you know, Project Talos will become
much more important with Mangu gone. Everything that Dr. Crowfoot has
been doing was aimed toward integrating the Chairman's personality
with the neural responses of Mangu's living mind and body, and that's
over with, now, that whole approach must be discarded.&quot;</P>
<P>Shadrach knows enough about Nikki's work to know
that this is not literally so; apparently Mangu was indeed the
template against which the Avatar personality-coding program was
being plotted, but there was nothing inexorable about the use of
Mangu; with the appropriate adjustments the project can readily be
reshaped around some other body donor. But there is no need to tell
Lindman that, if she wants to feel that her project, peripheral so
far, has suddenly become Genghis Mao's prime hope of postmortem
survival. She has made an obvious effort in the past minute or two to
be less intimidating, less abrasive, and he prefers her that way; he
will do nothing that might spur new tension and defensiveness in her.</P>
<P>In fact her mood has eased so much that she seems
almost coquettish. Chattering in a shrill, girlish, wholly
unKatyaesque way, she leads him on a hectic and gratuitous tour of
the laboratory, displaying circuit diagrams, boxes of memory chips,
prototypes for the pelvis and spine of the next model of Genghis Mao,
and other bits of Project Talos that are of no conceivable
significance just now; and he realizes, after a time, that her only
pretext for doing all this is to detain him, to have a few minutes
more of his company. It puzzles him. Lindman's usual manner is
aggressive and peremptory, but now she is coy, flirtatious, sidling
up unsubtly to him, plenty of heavy breathing and forthright eye
contact, actually grazing his elbow with her breasts as they stand
close together rummaging through a table full of schematics. Does she
think that such stuff will make him snort, sweat, paw the ground with
his hooves, fling himself upon her throbbing body? He has no idea
what she thinks. He rarely does. Nor is he going to find out now, for
whatever she is organizing here is truncated abruptly by a squeaky
summons from his pocket beeper, tracking him through the building. He
activates his portable telephone. Avogadro is calling.</P>
<P>&quot;Can you come to Security Vector One,
Doctor?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Now?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;If you would.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What's happening?&quot; Shadrach asks.</P>
<P>&quot;We've been interrogating Buckmaster. Your
name has&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh. <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">Ok.</SPAN><I>
</I>Am I a suspect too, now?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Hardly. A witness, perhaps. Can we expect
you in five minutes?&quot;</P>
<P>Shadrach looks at Katya, who is flushed, excited.
&quot;I have to go,&quot; he says. &quot;Avogadro. Something about
the Mangu inquiry. It sounds urgent.&quot;</P>
<P>Her face darkens. Her lips compress. But she says
only that she hopes to see him again soon, and, hiding her
disappointment behind a mask of detachment, she releases him. As he
leaves the laboratory he feels his entire body expand, as though i<SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">t</SPAN><I>
</I>had been held under great pressure while he was with her.</P>
<P>Security Vector One is on the sixty-fourth floor.
Mordecai has never had occasion to go there, and he has little idea
what to expect, other than standard police paraphernalia &mdash;magnifying
glasses and fingerprint pads all over the place, no doubt, photos of
known subversives mounted on tacky boards, sheafs of dossiers and
transcripts, rows of tap-terminals and fiber-eyes, whatever things
detectives would be likely to use in protecting the physical persons
of Genghis Mao and the PRC, Perhaps such things are there, but
Shadrach gets no glimpse of them. A feline, soft-voiced young man,
Oriental but too sinuous to be a Mongol, probably Chinese, greets him
at the reception desk and guides him through a labyrinth of
blank-walled hallways, past a nest of tiny offices where
weary-looking bureaucrats sit at desks heaped wish paper. The place
could be the headquarters of an insurance company, a bank, a
brokerage house. Only when he is ushered into the interrogation cell
where Avogadro and Buckmaster are waiting for him does he feel that
he is among the enforcers of the law.</P>
<P>The room is artfully claustrophobic, rectangular
and window-less, with dirty green walls and a low, oppressive ceiling
from which short-stalked spotlights dangle at the ends of jointed
metal arms. The spotlights are trained on the forehead of Roger
Buckmaster, who sits uncomfortably slouched in a squat, hard narrow
chair with broad aluminum armpieces and a high backrest. Electrodes
are taped to Buckmaster's wrists and temples; their leads disappear
into the recesses of the backrest. Buckmaster looks unnaturally pale,
sweaty, blotchy-faced; his eyes are glassy; his lips are slack.
Clearly Avogadro has been working him over for some while.</P>
<P>Avogadro, who is standing next to Buckmaster as
Shadrach enters, looks little better&mdash;grim, harried, frayed. &quot;A
madhouse,&quot; he mutters. &quot;Fifty arrests in the first hour. We
have every interrogation cell full and they're still coming in.
Lunatics, beggars, thieves, all the riffraff of Ulan Bator. And the
radicals, of course. I go from cell to cell, cell to cell. And for
what? For what?&quot; A rough-edged laugh. &quot;There'll be plenty
of meat for the organ farms before this is over.&quot; Slowly, moving
his heavy frame as though doubled gravity drags it down, he turns to
the man in the chair. &quot;Well, Buckmaster? You have a visitor. Do
you recognize him?&quot;</P>
<P>Buckmaster stares at the floor. &quot;You know
bloody well I do.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Let me be.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Tell me his name,&quot; Avogadro urges in a
tone that is tired but menacing.</P>
<P>&quot;Mordecai. Shadrach Bloody Mordecai. Em Dee.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Thank you, Buckmaster, Now tell me when you
last saw Dr. Mordecai.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Last night,&quot; Buckmaster says, his voice
a feeble fluting thing, barely audible.</P>
<P>&quot;Louder?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Last night.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Where?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You know where, Avogadro!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I want you to tell me yourself.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I already have.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Again. In front of Dr. Mordecai. Tell me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why don't you just carve me up and be done
with it?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You're making this hard for yourself,
Buckmaster. You're also making it hard for me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Pity.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I have no choice about this,&quot; Avogadro
says.</P>
<P>Lifting his head, Buckmaster manages a cold,
sullen, furious glare. &quot;Do I? Do I? Oh, I know the game. You'll
question me for a while, you&quot;ll find me guilty of conspiracy,
you'll sentence me to death, and off I go to the organ farm, right?
Right? And there I lie, a corpse that isn't dead, so that whenever
Genghis Mao needs a lung, a kidney, a heart, someone can come and cut
out mine, right? While I lie there, dead, warm, breathing and
meta-metabolizing, part of the stockpile.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Buckmaster&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>Buckmaster chuckles. &quot;Genghis Mao thinks the
stocks are getting low, and he can't use the miserable organ-rotted
people out there, so he turns on us, he tosses a few dozen of his own
people to the farms, right? Very well, take me away! Turn me into
cannibal food! But let's end this farce fast, shall we? Stop asking
me idiotic questions.&quot;</P>
<P>Avogadro sighs. &quot;To continue. You saw Dr.
Mordecai at&mdash;&quot;  
</P>
<P>&quot;Timbuktu.&quot;</P>
<P>Avogadro lifts his left hand. A security man
sitting at a table in the farthest corner does something to a control
console in front of him; Buckmaster jerks and twitches and the left
side of his face goes into a brief ugly spasm. &quot;You saw him
where?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Piccadilly Circus.&quot;</P>
<P>Again the left hand, higher. Again the touching of
controls; again the facial spasm, much worse. Shadrach Mordecai
shifts his weight uneasily from foot to foot. In a low voice he says,
&quot;Possibly it isn't necessary to&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It's necessary, yes,&quot; Avogadro tells
him. &quot;The forms must be observed.&quot; To Buckmaster he says,
&quot;I'm prepared to keep this up all day. It bores me, but it's my
job, and if <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">I</SPAN><I> </I>have to
hurt you, I'll hurt you, and if you make me cripple you, I'll cripple
you, because I have no choice. Do you understand? <I>I have no
choice. </I>Now, again: you met Dr. Mordecai in&mdash;&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Karakorum.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Where in Karakorum?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Outside the transtemporalists' tent.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;About what time?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I don't know. Late, but it was before
midnight.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Dr. Mordecai, is this correct? Your answers
will be recorded.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It's all correct so far,&quot; Shadrach
says. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Good. Go on, Buckmaster. Tell me what you
told me before. You encountered Dr. Mordecai and you said what to
him?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I spoke a lot of bloody nonsense.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;What kind of nonsense, Buckmaster?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Foolish talk. The transtemporalists jumbled
my mind with their drugs.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;What exactly did you say to the doctor?&quot;</P>
<P>Buckmaster, silent, stares at the floor. The right
hand of Avogadro rises almost to his shoulder. The controls are
adjusted. Buckmaster leaps in his seal as though speared. His right
arm thrashes about like an infuriated snake. &quot;Tell me,
Buckmaster. Please.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I accused him of doing evil.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Go on.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I called him a Judas.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;And a black bastard,&quot; Shadrach says. 
</P>
<P>Avogadro, with a gentle nudge, indicates to
Shadrach that his prompting is unwelcome.</P>
<P>&quot;Specifically, Buckmaster, what did you
accuse Dr. Mordecai of doing?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Of doing his job.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Meaning what?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;His job is keeping the Chairman alive. I
said he's responsible for keeping Genghis Mao from having died five
years ago.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Avogadro says, &quot;Is that correct, Dr.
Mordecai?&quot; 
</P>
<P>Shadrach hesitates. He doesn't particularly want
to cooperate in sending Buckmaster to the organ farm. But it would be
folly to try to protect the little man now. The truth about last
night's incident in Karakorum has already been drawn forth and
recorded, he knows. Buckmaster is condemned out of his own mouth. No
lie can save him, but only imperil the liar. &quot;It is,&quot; he
says.</P>
<P>&quot;So. Buckmaster, do you regret that Genghis
Mao didn't die five years ago?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Let me be, Avogadro.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Do you? Do you truly want the Chairman to be
dead? Is that your position?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I had the drug in my head!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You don't have the drug in your head now,
Buckmaster. What are your feelings about Genghis Mao at this moment?&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;I don't know. I simply don't know.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Hostile?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Perhaps. Look, Avogadro, don't force any
more out of me. You have me, you'll give me to the cannibals tonight,
isn't that enough for you?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;We can end this as soon as you cooperate.&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;Very well,&quot; Buckmaster says. He pulls
himself upright, finding some remaining resource of dignity. &quot;I
don't care for the regime of Genghis Mao. I am not in general
agreement with the policies of the PRC. I regret having devoted so
much effort to their service. I was overwrought last night and I said
a lot of foul things to Dr. Mordecai for which <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">I</SPAN><I>
</I>feel shame today. <I>But. </I>But, Avogadro! But I have never
done anything disloyal. And I don't know a thing about the death of
Mangu. I swear I had no part in it.&quot;</P>
<P>Avogadro nods. &quot;Dr. Mordecai. did the
prisoner mention Mangu last night?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I don't think he did.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Can you be more positive about that?&quot; 
</P>
<P>Shadrach considers. &quot;No,&quot; he says
finally. &quot;To the best of my recollection, he said nothing about
Mangu.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Did the prisoner make any threats against
the life of Genghis Mao?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Not that I recall.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Try to remember. Doctor.&quot;</P>
<P>Shadrach shakes his head. &quot;You have to
understand, I had just come out of the transtemporaltsts' tent
myself. My mind was still elsewhere during most of Buckmaster's
tirade. He did speak critically of the government, yes, quite
strongly, but I don't think there were any direct threats. No.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I should refresh your memory, then,&quot;
Avogadro says, gesturing to his assistant in the corner. There is a
hissing sound, and then, from an invisible speaker, the sound of a
voice, strangely familiar but oddly strange. His own.</P>
<P><I>This is suicidal, the way you're carrying on.
There'll be a report of all this on the Chairman's desk tomorrow,
Roger, more likely than not. You're destroying yourself.</I></P>
<P>&mdash;<I>I'll</I> <I>destroy </I>him. <I>The
bloodsucker. He holds us all for ransom, our bodies, our souls</I>&mdash;
</P>
<P>&quot;Again,&quot; Avogadro says. &quot;That last
bit.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&mdash;<I>I'll destroy him. The bloodsucker. He
holds us all for</I>&mdash; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Do you recognize those voices, Doctor?&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;Mine. Buckmaster's.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Thank you. The identification is important.
Who was it who said, 'I'll destroy <I>him'?&quot; </I>
</P>
<P>&quot;Buckmaster.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes. Thank you. Buckmaster, was that your
voice?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;You know it was.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Making a threat against the life of Genghis
Mao?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I was overwrought. I was making a rhetorical
point.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes,&quot; Shadrach Mordecai says. &quot;That's
how it seemed to me, I urged him not to shout nonsense. I can't see
it as any kind of serious threat. You have a tape of the whole
conversation?'' 
</P>
<P>&quot;The whole thing,&quot; Avogadro says. &quot;Many
conversations are taped, you know. And automatically screened for
subversion. The computers brought this to our attention early this
morning. The voiceprints told us it was you and Buckmaster, but of
course direct corroboration is useful&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;As though you'll have a trial, a jury,
lawyers,&quot; Buckmaster says bitterly. &quot;As though I won't be
meat by nightfall!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;He didn't say anything about Mangu to me
last night, did he?&quot; Shadrach asks. 
</P>
<P>&quot;No. Nothing on the tape.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;As I thought. Then why hold him?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Why defend him, Doctor? According to the
tape, he was insulting and offensive to you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I haven't forgotten. Nevertheless, I hold no
grudges. He was a nuisance to me last night, but being a nuisance
shouldn't be enough to make me want to see him sent to the organ
farms.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Tell him again!&quot; Buckmaster cries. &quot;Oh,
God, tell him!&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Please,&quot; Avogadro says. Buckmaster's
outburst appears to give him pain. He signals to his man, and
Buckmaster is unstrapped, freed of the electrodes, helped to his
feet, led from the room. At the door Buckmaster pauses and looks
back, face bleary, distorted with fear. His lips tremble; in a moment
he will be sobbing. &quot;I'm not the one!&quot; he cries, and the
security aides haul him away.</P>
<P>&quot;He isn't,&quot; Shadrach says. &quot;I'm
sure of that. He was out of his mind last night, ranting and
screaming, but he's no assassin. A malcontent, maybe. But no
assassin.&quot;</P>
<P>Avogadro, sinking limply into the interrogation
chair, plays with the electrodes, winding the snaky leads around his
fingers. &quot;I know that,&quot; he says.</P>
<P>&quot;What will happen to him?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;The organ farm. Probably before morning.&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;But why?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Genghis Mao's reviewed the tape. He regards
Buckmaster as dangerous.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Christ!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Go argue with Genghis Mao.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;You sound so calm about it,&quot; Shadrach
says. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's out of my hands. Doctor.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;We can't just let him be murdered!&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;We can't?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I can't.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;If you want to try to save him, go ahead. I
wish you well.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I might try. I might just.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The man called you a black bastard,&quot;
Avogadro says. &quot;And a Judas.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;For that I should let him be vivisected?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You aren't <I>letting </I>anything. It's
just happening. It's Buckmaster's problem. Not mine, not yours.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No man's an island, Avogadro.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Haven't I heard that before somewhere?&quot;</P>
<P>Shadrach stares. &quot;Aren't you at all
concerned? Don't you give a damn about justice?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Justice is for lawyers. Lawyers are an
extinct species. I'm only a security officer.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You don't believe that, Avogadro.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Don't I?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Christ. Christ. Don't come on with that
I'm-just-a-cop routine. You're too intelligent to mean it. And I'm
too intelligent to take it at face value.&quot;</P>
<P>Avogadro sits up. He has coiled two of the leads
around his throat in a bizarre clownish way, and his head is tilted
to one side, like that of a hanged man. &quot;Do you want me to play
you the Buckmaster tape? There's a place on it where you tell him
that it's not our fault the world is the way it is, that we accept
our karma, that we all serve Genghis Mao because he's the only game
in town. The alternative is organ-rot, nez-pah? Therefore we dance to
the Khan's tune, and we don't ask questions of morality, neither do
we unduly search our souls over matters of guilt and responsibility.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Wait. <I>You </I>said it. It's on tape,
<I>Dottore. </I>Now I say to you. I've forfeited the luxury of having
personal feelings about the righteousness of sending Bucky to the
organ farm. By entering the Khan's service I've given up the
privilege of having qualms.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Have you ever seen an organ farm?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;No,&quot; Avogadro says. &quot;But I hear&mdash;&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;I've seen them. Long quiet room, like a
hospital ward, but <I>very </I>quiet. Except for the burble of the
life-support machinery. Double row of open tanks, wide aisle between
them. One body in each tank, floating in warm blue-green fluid, a
nutrient bath. Intravenous tubes all over the floor, like pink
spaghetti. Dialysis machines between each pair of tanks. Before they
put a body in its tank, they kill the brain&mdash;spike through the
foramen magnum, <I>zap</I>&mdash;but the rest stays alive, Avogadro.
Vegetable in animal form. God knows what it perceives, but it lives,
it needs to be fed, it digests and excretes, the hair grows, the
fingernails, the nurses shave and groom the bodies every few weeks,
and there they lie, arranged neatly by blood type and tissue type,
available, gradually being stripped of limbs and organs, a kidney
this week, a lung the next, sliced down to torsos in easy stages, the
eyes, the fingers, the genitalia, eventually the heart, the liver&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;So? What's your point, Doctor? That organ
farms aren't pretty places? I know that. But it's an efficient way to
maintain organs awaiting transplant. Isn't it better to recycle
bodies than to waste them?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And turn an innocent man into a zombie?
Whose only purpose is to be a living storage depot for spare organs?&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;Buckmaster isn't innocent.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;What's he guilty of?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Guilty of bad judgment. Guilty of bad luck.
His number's up, Doctor.&quot; Avogadro, rising, lays his hand
lightly on Shadrach's arm. &quot;You're a man of conscience, aren't
you, <I>Dottore? </I>Buckmaster thought you were a cynical fiend, a
soulless servant of the Antichrist, but no, no, you're a decent sort,
caught in a nasty time, doing your best. Well, Doctor, so am I. I
quote your own words of last night: <I>Guilt is a luxury we can't
afford. </I>Amen! Now go. Stop worrying about Buckmaster.
Buckmaster's done himself in. If you hear the bell tolling, remember,
it tolls for him, and it doesn't diminish you or me at all, because
we've already diminished ourselves as much as possible.&quot;
Avogadro's smile is warm, almost pitying. &quot;Go, Doctor. Go and
relax. I have work to do. I have a dozen more suspects to question
before dinner.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;And the real murderer of Mangu&mdash;&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Was Mangu himself, nine to one. What's that
to me? I'll continue to find his killer and interrogate him and ship
him to the organ farms until I'm told to stop. Go, now. Go. Go.&quot;
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3><I>12</I></H3>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Word circulates, the next day, that thirteen
conspirators have been sent to the organ farms, including Roger
Buckmaster, the ringleader. Such rumors generally have a way of being
accurate, but Shadrach Mordecai, still finding the idea unpalatable,
goes to the extent of keying into the master personnel register to
find out where Buckmaster is. He tries the engineering department
code, but is told by the master computer that Buckmaster has been
reassigned to Department 111. Shadrach tries that code next, though
he knows what it is likely to be, and yes. Department 111 is the
euphemism for the organ farms. Buckmaster has joined the human
stockpile. Spike through the foramen magnum, <I>zap. </I>Poor silly
red-faced fool.</P>
<P>Dr. Mordecai chooses not to bring up the subject
of Buckmaster when he pays his morning call on the Chairman.
Buckmaster's fate seems beside the point now. 
</P>
<P>&quot;The conspiracy is crushed!&quot; Genghis Mao
declares vehemently as Shadrach enters. &quot;The guilty have been
punished. The threat to our regime has been met. The principles of
centripetal depolarization will not be challenged.&quot; His eyes
gleam with lunatic satisfaction. His ancient patchwork body throbs
with triumphant good health, reverberating in Shadrach's implants as
furious freshets of resurgent energy.</P>
<P>Shadrach takes blood samples, administers
medicines, checks reflexes; the Khan pays no more heed to him than if
he were an orderly changing the bed linens. He is altogether
preoccupied, it appears, with his proliferating schemes for the
deification of Mangu. Already blueprints for Mangu monuments have
been drawn up, and they are spread everywhere in rustling heaps
across the Chairman's bed, over his bony upjutting knees and on both
sides of him and tumbling to the floor. Humming tunelessly, Genghis
Mao turns the documents this way and that, nodding, scribbling
marginal notes, muttering private observations. &quot;Hah! I like
this!&quot; Genghis Mao exclaims sharply. &quot;Patterned after the
Great Pyramid of Gizeh, but twice the size, with statues of Mangu
twenty meters high rising out of each of the four faces. What do you
think?&quot; He shoves the blueprint toward Mordecai. &quot;It's
Ionigylakis's idea. He's trying to improve on antiquity, like
everyone else. How do you like it, Shadrach?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;The statues, sir. They&mdash;ah&mdash;tend
to break the line of the pyramid, wouldn't you say?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;What's wrong with that?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Pyramids are so graceful,&quot; Shadrach
says. &quot;So compact.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;The original pyramid is an exhausted
concept,&quot; the Chairman snaps. &quot;What I like about this is
the contrast in angles, the slope of the pyramid's face versus the
upright statue working against it, do you see? Mangu is rising
upward, outward, away from the center&mdash;it's centripetal,
Shadrach! Do you see?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Centrifugal, I'd say, sir.&quot;</P>
<P>Genghis Mao gapes as though his doctor has struck
him. &quot;Centrifugal? Centrifugal? Are you serious?&quot; He breaks
into frantic laughter. &quot;A joke! My earnest Shadrach makes a
joke! Tell me: do you think Mangu was in great pain?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;He must have died instantly. I doubt that he
was conscious as he fell. The acceleration&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes. Look at this one, will you? A helical
spire, it says here, nine hundred meters high, a great metal coil
through which a magnetic field flows, and a perpetual bolt of
lightning flickering at the tip&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Sir, if you would, the tritetrazol
injection&mdash;&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Later, Shadrach.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The absorption levels are already slightly
above optimum. If I could have your arm&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;&mdash;and here, yes, I like this. A giant
sarcophagus of alabaster, inlaid with onyx&mdash;&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;&mdash;clench your fist, sir&mdash;&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;&mdash;build a tomb worthy of&mdash;&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;&mdash;if you'd hold your breath, count to
five&mdash;&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;&mdash;a scale befitting Alexander the
Great, Tut-ankh-Amen, even Genghis Khan himself. Yes, why not?
Mangu&mdash;&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;&mdash;and relax now, sir&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;&mdash;Ch'in Shih Huang Ti! There's our
prototype! Do you know him, Shadrach?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Sir?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;&mdash;Ch'in Shih Huang Ti.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'm afraid I&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The First Emperor of China, the Unifier, the
builder of the Great Wall. Do you know how they buried him?&quot;
Genghis Mao scrabbles through the documents on his bed and comes up
with a sheaf of pale green printouts, which he brandishes wildly in
Shadrach's face. &quot;Agreat hill of sand, south of the River Wei,
at the foot of Mount Li. Or was it Mount Wei, River Li? Wei. Li. In
the mound a palace, and the palace contained a relief map of China
modeled in bronze, depicting the rivers, mountains, valleys, plains.
The Yangtze and the Huang Ho had channels four meters deep, filled
with quicksilver. Models of cities and palaces along their banks, and
a great dome of bright copper overhead, yes, with the moon and the
constellations engraved on it. The coffin of the First Emperor, then,
floated on one of the quicksilver rivers, Shadrach! An endless
journey across China. Silent, slippery&mdash;oh, bathe me in
quicksilver, Shadrach, let me sleep on quicksilver! Do you see the
coffin? And a powerful bow mounted at the coffin's side, ready to
hurl an arrow at any intruder. Trapdoors and hidden knives waiting
for the grave-robbers, too, and thunder-making machines &mdash;and
hundreds of slaves and artisans buried in the mound with Ch'in Shih
Huang Ti to serve him, yes. Grandeur! What do you think? Should I
build this for Mangu?&quot; The Khan blinks, frowns, moistens his
lips. Shadrach Mordecai perceives changes in skin temperature and
blood pressure. &quot;On the other hand&mdash;if I build such a tomb
for Mangu, what could I provide for myself? Surely I deserve
something finer. But what&mdash;what&mdash;&quot; Genghis Mao breaks
into a broad grin. &quot;There's time to plan it! Twenty, fifty
years! Why should I think now of tombs for Genghis Mao? It's Mangu we
bury. I'll give him the finest!&quot; The old man pushes the
blueprints into a heap. &quot;Forty-one guilty conspirators to the
organ farms so far, Shadrach.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I had heard thirteen.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Forty-one, and we're not finished. I've told
Avogadro to bring in at least a hundred. Think of the livers going
into storage! The kilometers of intestine. How beautiful the farms
are, Shadrach. I hate waste of all kinds. You know that. To conserve.
It's a kind of poetry. Forty-one more tanks filled. And the threat to
the government is put down.&quot; Genghis Mao's voice grows dark,
hollow. &quot;But Mangu&mdash;what have they done to Mangu? My other
self&mdash;my self-in-waiting&mdash;my prince, my viceroy&mdash;&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;Sir, perhaps you're becoming overexcited.&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;I feel fine. Shadrach.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;But some rest&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Rest? I don't need to rest. I could get out
of bed now and run from here to Karakorum. Rest, for what? Are you
worried about me, Shadrach?&quot; The Chairman's laughter bursts
forth, booming, resonant. &quot;I feel fine. Never better. Stop
worrying. What an old woman you are, Shadrach. Are you a Christian?&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;Sir?&quot; Shadrach says blankly.</P>
<P>&quot;A Christian. A Christian. Do you accept the
Only Begotten Son of God as your Savior? What? Can't you hear? The
ears going bad? I'll ask Warhaftig to give you new eardrums. I asked
you, Are you a Christian?&quot; 
</P>
<P>Baffling. &quot;Well&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You know. You know. <I>Pater noster qui </I>art
in heaven. Ave Maria full of grace. Whoever eats my flesh and drinks
my blood has life eternal, and I will raise him up on the last day,
says the Lord. Yes? You know of this? Lamb of God you take away the
sins of the world, <I>Ite missa est. </I>Well?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, my parents sometimes took me to
church, but I can't really say that I&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Too bad. Not a believer?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;In the narrow sense of the word, perhaps,
but&mdash;&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;There's only one sense of the word, it seems
to me.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I don't think I'm a believer, then.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Well, hallowed be thy name. Would you like
to be Pope anyway?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Sir?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Is that all you can say? <I>Sir? Sir?&quot;
</I>Genghis Mao mimics his obsequiousness with devastating ferocity.
The Khan's pulse is rising; his face is flushed. &quot;The kingdom
and the power. Oh, and the glory. You Christians, you understand. I
am the way, the truth, and the life, says the Lord; no one comes to
the Father, except through me.&quot; This manic volatility disturbs
Dr. Mordecai, who surreptitiously boosts the Khan's tranquilizer
intake, hitting the 9-pordenone pedal while pretending to examine the
base of the life-support system. Genghis Mao, sitting up, shouting
now, cries, &quot;Answer yes, answer no, but no more sirs! Pope! I
asked you, would you like to be Pope? The Pope is dead in Rome, old
Benedict. The cardinals will meet this summer. I am invited to offer
a nominee. I'll send them the name of my doctor, my beautiful black
doctor, yes? <I>Le Pape Noir. Il Papa Negro. </I>There have been
black saints, why not a black Pope? Pick your own regnal name. It's
one of the  idle dividends of the power and the glory. What do you
say to Papa Legba? Eh? Eh?&quot; Genghis Mao claps his hands. &quot;Papa
Legba! Papa Legba!&quot;</P>
<P>The new liver, Shadrach thinks. Could it have been
the liver of a madman?</P>
<P>He says mildly, &quot;I'm not Roman Catholic,
sir.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You could become one. Is that so hard? A
week of coaching and you'd know how to mumble the right words. <I>Kyrie
eleison. Credo in unum deum. Om mani padme hum.</I>&quot;</P>
<P>There is something ominous in all this crazy talk
of poping. Genghis Mao's lightning shifts of subject, his hectic flow
of fantasies, his volcanic verbal outpour, do not inspire confidence
in Genghis Mao's mental stability. This is the man who rules the
world, Shadrach reflects. Such that it is.</P>
<P>Shadrach says, &quot;If I became Pope, who would
be your doctor?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why, you would, Shadrach.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;From Rome?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;We'd move the Vatican to Ulan Bator.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Even so, I don't think I could do justice to
both <I>jobs, </I>sir.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;A young man like you? Of course you could.
What are you, thirty-five years old, thirty-eight, something like
that? You'd be a splendid Pope. I'd become Catholic myself, and you
could hear my confession. Don't refuse the offer, Shadrach. I think
you don't have enough to do as things are now. You need distractions.
You spend too much of your time doctoring me, because your days are
otherwise idle. You fill me with needless medicines. Why are you
staring at me like that?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'd prefer not to become Pope, sir.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Final decision?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Final.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;All right. I'll name Avogadro.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;At least he's Italian.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;You think I'm insane, Shadrach?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Sir, I think you're overtaxing yourself. I
prescribe two hours of total rest. May I give you a sleep tab?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You may not. You may leave and amuse
yourself in Karakorum. Gonchigdorge will be Pope, yes, a Mongol, do
you like that? I like that. You, up there, sainted old Father
Genghis, old Temujin, do you like that? Leave me, Shadrach. You annoy
me today. <I>I</I> <I>am not insane. </I>I am not overtaxing myself.
The death of Mangu distresses me. I grieve for Mangu. I will make the
world remember Mangu forever. Forty-one to the farms, and it's only
morning! Will you take yourself to Karakorum?&quot;</P>
<P>The metabolic levels are rising on a dozen fronts.
Shadrach is alarmed. He manipulates the tranquilizer pedal once
again. The old man must be awash in 9-pordenone now, but somehow
Genghis Mao overrides it, remaining in the manic mode despite the
drug. It is at last taking effect, though. At last, some sign of
calming. The Khan subsides. Shadrach departs, troubled, but confident
that the Khan's temperament will stabilize for a time. As he goes
out, Genghis Mao calls after him, &quot;Or King of England! What do
you say? There'll be a vacancy in Windsor soon.&rdquo;</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3><I>13</I></H3>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>He goes to Karakorum with Katya Lindman.
Ordinarily he spends his free evenings with Nikki Crowfoot, but not
always; they are not husband and wife, there is no monogamy between
them. He loves Crowfoot, or believes he does, which amounts to the
same thing for him. But he has never been able to escape Lindman for
long. Now she is in the ascendant, like baleful Saturn rising into
the house of Aquarius. This night will be hers. Nikki is elsewhere,
anyway, he knows not where; he is free, accessible, vulnerable.</P>
<P>&quot;You'll do the dreams with me tonight?&quot;</P>
<P>Why not? Her harsh forceful contralto has maimed
his will. He shall allow himself finally to be indoctrinated into the
mysteries of dream-death. Her dark eyes sparkle with savage succubal
glee as he nods his agreement. 
</P>
<P>The dream-death pavilion is a wide many-poled
tent, black cloth with trim of rusty orange stripes. Over its
entrance is mounted a great jutting image of a ram's head, heavy,
glowering, aggressive, spearing the chilly spring air with massive
superprepotent coiled homs. Shadrach knows the ram is Amon-Re, lord
of fear, king of the sun, patron of dream-death; for this cult is
said to be derived from Pharaonic Egypt, secret rites never lost
since first they were practiced along the shores of the sluggish,
sweltering Nile in the time of the Fifth Dynasty. Within the tent,
surprisingly, all is light. The place is ablaze with glowing fixtures
from floor to ceiling&mdash;hanging lamps, floor-poles, spots,
cascading lavalieres of radiance, so that the air burns with a
numbing blue-while brightness and all shadows are obliterated.
Shadrach, remembering the murky atmosphere of the transtemporalists'
tent, is taken aback by this intense luminosity. But in the realm of
Amon-Re a solar brilliance must prevail.</P>
<P>A costumed figure approaches, a slender Oriental
female who wears nothing but a twist of white linen around her hips
and a huge gilded lioness-mask that rests ponderously on her slim
shoulders. Between her dainty breasts hangs a pendant, the crux
ansata, in fiery gold. She does not speak; but with expressive
gestures she leads Mordecai and Lindman through the crowded tent,
past scores of sleepers who lie on fluffy mattresses of white cotton
surrounded by high barriers of golden rope strung through ebony
stanchions, to a vacant cubicle that is to be theirs. Within the ring
of rope lie two thick mattresses side by side, a neatly folded
dreaming costume beside each one, and an ornate wooden trunk which,
their guide indicates, is for their street clothes. Katya immediately
begins to strip, and Shadrach, after a moment, does the same. The
guide stands aside, showing no interest in their nakedness. Shadrach
feels foolish in his costume&mdash;a single handkerchief-sized square
of linen to cover his loins and thighs, a beaded belt with which to
fasten it around his hips, and two narrow strips of cloth, one green,
one blue, which the guide helps him fasten crosswise over his chest.</P>
<P>Katya smiles at him. He feels heavy lust,
unleavened by love or even by joy, as she removes her clothes. That
dense dark pubic thatch, broad and curling, spilling into the corners
of her thighs, exerts a terrible pull: he longs with weird intensity
to bury his sex in it, to plunge like a hatchet to her hot
unforgiving depths and stay there, motionless. Lindman dons a
one-piece loincloth similar to his and a looped-cross pendant
identical to the guide's. These enhance, rather than mask, her
nakedness. As always, her body disturbs him: wide-hipped,
heavy-rumped, a peasant-woman's body, the center of gravity quite
low, the navel deep, hidden in smooth slabs of belly fat, the breasts
full and somewhat elongated. It is a strong and voluptuous body,
powerful without being at all athletic, as exaggeratedly female as
those primordial Venuses out of the Cro-Magnon caves. What bothers
Shadrach most, he suspects, is the contrast between that robustly
sexual earth-mother body and those thin, predatory lips, those sharp,
threatening teeth. Katya's mouth is untrue to the archetype that the
rest of her body projects, and that contradiction makes her a mystery
to Shadrach. <I>Falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus, </I>perhaps.</P>
<P>The lioness-headed one invites them to kneel on
their mattresses and hands each of them a polished metal talisman. It
seems at first to be no more than a mirror, a bright blank planchet
with quasi-Egyptian motifs around its rim, small engravings of the
Horushawk, serpents, scorpions, scarabs, bees, the ibis of Thoth,
interspersed with tiny portentous-looking hieroglyphs; but as he
stares Shadrach begins to perceive a dizzying pattern of almost
invisible dotted lines spiraling around the middle of the amulet;
these lines, he realizes, may be seen only when the angle at which he
holds the talisman in relation to a certain brilliant lamp over his
head is just right; and, by moving the device ever so slightly, he
can make the lines appear to move, to swirl in a counterclockwise
eddy, to create a vortex&mdash; 
</P>
<P>&mdash;sucking him toward the center of the disk&mdash;
</P>
<P>So they work by hypnotism here rather than by
drugs, he thinks, feeling smug, scientific, Shadrach the scholar, the
detached observer of all human phenomena, and then he feels an
irresistible tug, he finds himself caught, drawn helplessly inward, a
mere speck blown on the cosmic winds, a mote, a phantasm&mdash;</P>
<P>&mdash;one moment kneeling here admiring the
cleverness of the mechanism and a moment later gripped, held, pulled,
altogether incapable of objective considerations, <I>animate vagula
blandute hospes comesque corporis</I>&mdash;</P>
<P>As he goes under, the priestess, for so he must
think of her, begins a rhythmic chant, fragmentary and elusive, a
mingling of English words and Mongol and bits of what might well be
Pharaonic Egyptian, invocations of Set, Hathor, Isis, Anubis, Bast.
Figures out of myth surround him in the sudden shadows, the
hawk-headed god, the great jackal, the dog-faced ape, the vast
clicking scatabaeus, desiccated deities exchanging knowing comments
in opaque tongues, nodding, pointing. Here is Father Amon, bright as
solar fire, turbulent as the skin of the sun, beckoning to him. Here
is the beast with no face, radiating streams of siarflame. Here is
the dwarf-god, the buffoon, the protector of the dead, capering and
guffawing. Here is the goddess with a woman's body and the heads of
three snakes. The gods dance, laugh, pass water, spit, weep, clap
hands. Still the priestess chants. Her words, chasing one another
round and round, seize and control him. He can barely comprehend
anything any longer, all structures having dissolved and become
formless, but yet he is remotely aware that he is being programmed,
being propelled, being given by this slim naked yellow girl who
speaks in impassive sing-song certain attitudes toward death and life
that will shape his experience in the hours just ahead. She has him,
she leads him, she guides and aims him as he tosses on the
eschatological breeze.</P>
<P>He is being pulled apart. Something is gently and
painlessly severing him from himself. He has never fell anything like
this before, not in the tent of the transtemporalists, not when
taking any of the traditional psychedelics, not on kot, not on yipka:
this is new, this is unique, a shedding of mass, a dropping away of
the flesh, a liberation into weightlessness. He knows he is&mdash;</P>
<P>&mdash;dying?&mdash;</P>
<P>Yes, dying. that's the commodity offered here,
death, the actual experience of departing from life, of having life
depart from oneself. He can no longer feel his body. He is beyond all
exterior sensation. This is the true death, that ultimate sundering
toward which his life has moved throughout all its days; no
simulation, no hypnotic trick, but real and actual death, the
going-forth of Shadrach Mordecai. Of course, on a deeper level he
knows it is only a dream, a night's amusement purchased for sport;
but under that awareness lies the realization that he may be dreaming
that he is dreaming, dreaming the talisman and the tent and the
lioness-girl, that he may really have fallen through the illusion of
an illusion and really is dying here tonight. It does not matter.</P>
<P>How easy dying is! There is a cool moist gray mist
about him, and everything dissolves in it, Anubis and Thoth, Katya
and the priestess, the tent, the amulet, Shadrach himself, invaded
and interpenetrated by the grayness until he is part of it. He floats
toward the center of the void. Is this what Genghis Mao fears so
much? To be a balloon and nothing but a balloon, so much helium
surrounded by a nonexistent skin, to put aside all responsibility
and, liberated wholly, to float and float? Genghis Mao is so <I>heavy.
</I>He carries so much weight. It may be hard to relinquish that. Not
for Shadrach. He passes through the center and emerges on the far
side, congealing nicely out of the mist and resuming his human form.
He is altogether naked now, not even a scrap at the waist. Katya,
naked also, stands beside him. At their feet lie their discarded
bodies, relaxed, limp, seemingly asleep, even giving the appearance
of slow rhythmic breathing, but not so: they are actually dead, truly
and really dead. Shadrach Mordecai beholds his own corpse. &quot;How
quiet it is here,&quot; Katya says. &quot;And clean. They've washed
the world for us.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Where shall we go?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Anywhere.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The circus? The bullfight? The marketplace?
Anywhere?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Anywhere,&quot; Shadrach says. &quot;Yes.
Let's go anywhere.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Effortlessly they float into the world. The
lioness waves farewell. The air is mild and balmy. The trees are in
bloom, fireflowers, little cups of flame spouting at the tips of the
branches; they break loose and drift down, swirl about, approach
them, touch them, sink sweetly into their bodies. Shadrach watches
the passage of a blazing red blossom through Katya's breastbone; it
emerges between her shoulders, falls lightly to the ground, goes to
seed, sprouts. A skinny sapling rises and bursts into flaming flower.
They laugh like children. Together they stride across the continent.
The sands of the Gobi sparkle. The Great Wall stretches before them,
a wriggling stone serpent humping its back.</P>
<P>&quot;Why, it's Nigger Jim and Little Nell!&quot;
cries Ch'in Shih Huang Ti, who stands atop the Wall. He does a little
dance of joy, doffing his silken black skullcap, letting his long
elaborate pigtails wave about.</P>
<P>&quot;Chop-chop,&quot; Shadrach says. &quot;Kung
po chi ding!&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Which way to the egress?&quot; Katya asks. 
</P>
<P>&quot;There,&quot; says the First Emperor. &quot;Past
the chains, over the spikes.&quot;</P>
<P>They go through the gate. On the far side of the
Great Wall are flooded rice paddies glittering in rosy sunlight.
Women in black pajamas and broad coolie hats move slowly through
ankle-deep water, stooping, planting, stooping, planting. Invisible
chorus off screen. Swelling crescendo of celestial sound. Katya
scoops rich yellow mud and hurls it at him. Glop! He throws mud at
her. Glip! They plaster each other with it and embrace, slippery and
wriggling. What sweet slime! They laugh; they romp; they tumble and
topple, landing in the rice paddy with a splash, and the Chinese
women dance around them. Huang! Ho! Lindman legs grasp his hips.
Thighs like clamps. She reaches for him. They couple to the mud like
rutting buffalo. Gripping one another, rolling over and over.
Snorting. Slapping flesh. Wallowing in the primeval ooze. Very
gratifying. Nostalgia for the mud. Belly to belly. He does not
perceive his rigid organ as anything that particularly belongs to
him, but rather as something shared, an independent connecting rod
that passes back and forth in swift reciprocations between their
clasped bodies. Without reaching a climax they rise, bathe, move on
to New York. A hot wind blows through this city of sky-stabbing
towers. Confetti showers down upon them; it stings, it burns. Cheers
of the inhabitants. Everyone has organ-rot here, but it is accepted;
it causes no alarm. The bodies of the New Yorkers are transparent,
and Shadrach sees the red lesions within, the zones of corruption and
decay, the eruptions and erosions and suppurations of intestines,
lungs, vascular tissue, peritoneum, pericardium, spleen, liver,
pancreas. The disease announces itself in radiating waves of
low-spectrum electromagnetic pulsations, hammering dully at his soul,
red red red. These people are full of holes from fetlock to gunwale
and yet they are happy, as why should they not be? Shadrach and Katya
do a buck-and-wing down Fifth Avenue. Shadrach's skin is white. His
lips are thin. His hair is straight and long; it blows across his
face, momentarily blinding him, and when he clears it he sees that
Katya now is black. Flat broad flanged nose, splendid steatopygous
ass, yards of chocolate skin. Ruby lips, sweeter than wine. &quot;Poon!&quot;
she cries.</P>
<P>&quot;Tang!&quot; he replies. &quot;Hot!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Cha!&quot;</P>
<P>They dance on swords. They dance on pineapples. He
sells her into slavery and redeems her with his first-born. &quot;Are
we dead?&quot; he asks her. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Really and truly dead?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Is it supposed to be this much fun?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Are you having fun?&quot; she asks.</P>
<P>They are in Mexico. Frangipani, flamboyans. It is
spring: the cacti are in bloom. Towering spiny green poles topped by
crazy clusters of fragrant yellow petals. Loops and whorls of
thotni-ness exploding in gaudy firecracker bursts of red and white.
They sleepwalk through the prickly pears. They somnambulate among the
pitahayas. The pace is frantic but restful. Often they make love. He
could waltz all night. Crossing the Pyrenees, they meet Pancho
Sanchez, squat and greasy, who offers them green wine out of a
leather bota and giggles shrilly when they spill it on themselves.
Pancho licks wine from Katya's breasts. She gives him a merry shove
and he somersaults into Andorra. They follow. Commemorative coins of
high denomination are struck in their honor by the adoring populace.
&quot;I thought death would be more serious,&quot; Shadrach says. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It is.&quot;</P>
<P>Dead, they can go anywhere, and they do. But the
journey is an empty one and the food at the feast is mere spun air,
less sweet than cotton candy. He wishes for more substance and the
servants bring him stones. He is black again, and so is Genghis Mao,
enthroned in a seat of glistening jade ten meters overhead. Ficifolia
is black, Buckmaster, Avogadro, Nikki Crowfoot; Mangu is the blackest
of all; but the black of their skins is not Negro-black, not
African-black, it is black-black, ebony-black, the color of a dark
closet, the color of the air between the worlds. Black as the pit.
They look like beings from some other galaxy. Shadrach goes among
them, slapping palms, touching elbows. They speak nigger-Mongol to
one another, they laugh and sing, they shuffle and shake. Ficifolia
is on guitar, Buckmaster on Jew's harp, Avogadro on banjo; Shadrach
plays the bongos, Katya the tambourine.</P>

<P>&quot;It isn't really this good,&quot; Shadrach
tells Katya. &quot;We're fooling ourselves.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It has its points.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I can't help feeling suspicious.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Even dead you can't really let yourself go,
can you?&quot; 
</P>
<P>She takes him by the wrist and pulls him along
with her, through a desert of sparkling sands, through a river of
leaping white water, through a thicket of dense aromatic brambles,
into the ocean, the great salty mother, and they lie on their backs,
looking up into the sun. He is utterly becalmed.</P>
<P>&quot;How long does it go on?&quot; be asks.</P>
<P>&quot;Forever.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;When does it end?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It doesn't.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Really?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Nature of the state. Death is nothing but a
continuation of life by different means.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I don't believe it. <I>Dopo la morte,
nulla.&quot;</I></P>
<P>&quot;Then where are we now?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Dreaming,&quot; he says.</P>
<P>&quot;Sharing the same dream? Don't be a fool.&quot;</P>
<P>The snouts of sharks poke through the gentle
surface of the sea. Toothy jaws gape. Shadrach practices
fearlessness. These beasts can do him no harm. He is, after all,
dead. He is also a doctor of medicine. He gulps ocean until the
shining sandy floor is laid bare and the sharks, beached, morosely
flop about, munching on crabs and starfish. Shadrach laughs. Death is
real, death is earnest! Out of the north come frosty winds, roaring
down the flanks of the Himalayas. Indefatigably they continue the
ascent of the North Cwm, clawing up the rocky face piton by piton,
staring constantly at the formidable tapering peak rising like a
giant whelk at the head of the valley. They shiver in their parkas;
they clutch their ice-axes with weary hands; their oxygen tanks press
inexorably against their aching shoulders; and still they climb, now
into that giddy realm above seven thousand meters, where only the
splay-footed snowmen dare to go. The summit is in sight. Vast
crevasses loom, but they have no meaning; where crampons and pitons
will not serve, Shadrach and Katya simply launch themselves into
great sky-spanning leaps. It is too easy. He had not thought death to
be so frivolous a place. Indeed now the sky is darkening, the pace is
slowing; he hears solemn music, he experiences a lessening of the
frenetic urges that have driven him thus far, he settles into a
glacial calm, an Egyptian timelessness. He is one with Ptah and
Osiris. He is a twanging Memnon beside the mighty river, waiting out
the eons. Katya winks at him and he scowls his disapproval. Death is
serious business, not a holiday. Ah, yes, now he has it, the proper
pace, He is wholly absorbed by the task of being dead. He does not
move. Vital signs nil; intellection nil; he has reached the core of
the event. <I>Hic jacet. Nascentes morimur, finisque ab origine
pendet. Mors omnia solvit. </I>Let there be trombones, please. <I>Missa
pro defunctis. Requiem aeternam dona eis, Domine. </I>It is very
quiet here. When they speak at all, they speak in Sanskrit, Aramaic,
Sumerian, or, of course, Latin. Thoth himself speaks Latin. Doubtless
other tongues too, but the gods themselves have whims. How sweet it
is to be immobile and to think, if at all, only in languages one no
longer understands! <I>Nullum est jam dictum quod non dictum est
prius. </I>What a good sound that has! If you would, a little more
volume on the basset horns:</P>

</P>
<P>Gradually the voices diminish. The music becomes
subdued and abstract as it fades; the sound of the instruments now is
hollow, a mere outline of sound, blank within, the idea of sound
rather than sound itself, and the chorus, far away, sings the
terrible words of the ancient prayer in a faint, cluttering,
rustling, elegant tone, poignant and penetrating:</P>

<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>And then all is silent. Now he is at peace. He has
reached the essence of the dream-death, an end to striving, an end to
seeking.</P>
<P>The chase is over. He could go, if he wished, to
Bangkok, Addis Ababa, San Francisco, Bagdad, Jerusalem, traveling
with no more effort than it takes to blink an eye, but there is no
reason to go anywhere, for all places have become one, and it is
better to remain here, at the still point, motionless, swaddled in
the soft sweet woolly fleece of the grave. <I>Consummation est. </I>He
is in perfect equilibrium. He is finally, truly dead. He knows he
will sleep forever.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Instantly he wakes. His mind is clear, tingling,
painfully alert. Passion inflames his penis, passion or else the
blind force that comes over men in dreams; at any rate it juts
shamelessly against his loincloth, making a little pyramid out of his
lap. Katya lies not far away, propped up on her elbows, watching him.
Her smile is sphinxlike. He sees her broad fleshy bareback, her firm
meaty buttocks, and instantly the tranquility of dream-death is gone;
lust rules him. &quot;Let's go,&quot; he says hoarsely. 
</P>
<P>&quot;All right.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It isn't far to the lovers' hospice.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;No. Not there.&quot; She has already begun
to dress. The lioness-guide is across the aisle, greeting newcomers.
The brightness of the air leaves Shadrach dazzled. Anubis and Thoth
still lurk somewhere nearby, he is convinced. He struggles to regain
that vanished equilibrium, to find his way back to the still point,
but he knows it will take many more dream-death sessions before he
can reach that calm place on his own. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Where?&quot; he says.</P>
<P>&quot;At the tower. I hate making love in rented
rooms. Didn't you know that?&quot;</P>
<P>So he must stifle his longings another hour or
two. Perhaps that's the lesson of dream-death: delay gratification,
purify the spirit. Or perhaps not. It is a jolt, stepping from the
radiant ambiance of the dream-death tent to the darkness without, and
the night is cold, very cold even for the Mongolian May, just a hint
of snow in the air, a few hard little flakes whipping on the breeze.
Riding the tube-train back they say almost nothing to each other, but
as they approach the Ulan Bator station he says, &quot;Were you
really there?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;In your dream?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes. When we met Pancho Sanchez. And the
First Emperor. And when we went to Mexico.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That was your dream,&quot; she says. &quot;I
was having other dreams.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh. Oh. I wondered. It seemed very real,
talking to you, having you beside me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The dreams always seem that way.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;But I'm surprised at how playful it was.
Frivolous, even.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Is that how it was for you?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Until the end,&quot; he says. &quot;It got
solemn then. When things grew calm. But before then&mdash;&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Frivolous?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Very frivolous, Katya.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;For me it was solemn all the time. A great
quietness.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Is it different for everybody?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Of course,&quot; she says. &quot;What did
you think?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Oh.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You thought, when you met me in your dream,
that I was actually there, talking with you, sharing your
experiences?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I confess that I did.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;No. I wasn't there.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No. I suppose not.&quot; He laughs. &quot;All
right. I wasn't thinking. For you it was somber. For me it was all
games. What does that say about you, about me?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Nothing, Shadrach.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Really?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Nothing at all.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;We don't express something about our inner
selves in the dreams we choose for ourselves?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;No,&quot; she says. 
</P>
<P>&quot;How can you be so sure?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The dreams are chosen for us. By a stranger.
I don't know more than that, but the woman in the mask told us what
to dream. The broad outlines. The tone.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And we have no choice about the content?&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;Some. Her Instructions are filtered through
our sensibilities. But still&mdash;still&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Is your dream always the same?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;In content? In tone?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Tone.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The dream is always different, &quot; Katya
says. &quot;And yet the flavor is the same, for death is always the
same. Different things happen each time, but the dream brings you
always to the same place, in the same way, at the end.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;To the still point?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You could call it that. Yes. Yes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And the meaning of what I dreamed&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No,&quot; she says. &quot;Don't talk about
meaning. Dream-death gives no oracular wisdom. The dream is without
meaning.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The tube-train has reached Ulan Bator. &quot;Come,&quot;
Katya says.</P>
<P>They go to her suite, two floors below Nikki
Crowfoot's, a dark place, three small rooms furnished with stark,
heavy hangings. Once more they are naked before one another, once
more he feels the overwhelming pull of Katya's thick sturdy body; he
moves stiffly toward her, embraces her, digs the tips of his fingers
into the deep flesh of her shoulders and back. But he cannot bring
himself to kiss that terrifying mouth. He thinks of the joyous
couplings he shared with her in dream-death, the rice paddy, the
fragrant Mexican nights, and he tugs her down with him to the bed;
but, though he fills his hands with her breasts, though he imprisons
his head between her smooth cool thighs, though he drives himself
urgently against her flesh, he is altogether unmanned by her physical
presence, helpless, limp. Not for the first time, either: their
sporadic lovemaking has always been marked by such difficulties,
which he rarely experiences with other women. Katya is not bothered
by this: calmly she pushes him back against the pillow with a thump
of her knuckles on his chest, and then, bending forward, she goes to
work on him with her mouth, her sinister and ferocious sharp-fanged
mouth, lovingly engulfing him, and he feels lips and tongue, lips and
tongue, warm and wet, no hint of teeth at all, and under her cunning
ministrations he relaxes, he puts aside his fear of her, he grows
stiff at last. Deftly she slides upward over him&mdash;it is a
maneuver she has clearly practiced often&mdash;and, with a sudden
startling thrust, drives herself downward, impaling herself on him.
She squats astraddle, peasant-strong, above him, knees flexed,
buttocks taut, body rocking. He looks at her and sees her face
distorted by the early spasms of ecstasy, nostrils flared, eyes tight
shut, lips pulled back in a fierce grimace; then he closes his own
eyes and gives himself up fully to their union. An awesome energy
courses through her. She rides him, now squatting high so that their
only contact is at their loins, now pressing herself full length
against his body, but always remaining above him, always staying in
command. He does not object to this. She writhes, grinds, pushes,
twists, suddenly rears back and breaks into bizarre laughter; it is,
he knows, her signal, and he seizes her breasts and joins her in the
final climax.</P>
<P>Afterward he dozes, and wakes to find her quietly
sobbing. How strange, how unlike her! He had never imagined Lindman
to be capable of tears.</P>
<P>&quot;What's wrong?&quot;</P>
<P>She shakes her head.</P>
<P>&quot;Katya?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Nothing. Please.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What is it?&quot;</P>
<P>Sullenly, face against pillow, she says, &quot;I'm
afraid for you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Afraid? Why? What about?&quot;</P>
<P>She looks toward him and shakes her head again.
She clamps her lips. Suddenly her mouth looks not at all fierce. A
child's mouth. She is frightened.</P>
<P>&quot;Katya?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Please, Shadrach.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I don't understand.&quot;</P>
<P>She says nothing. She shakes her head. She shakes
her head.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3><I>14</I></H3>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Over a week goes by before Shadrach sees Nikki
Crowfoot again. She claims she is very busy in the
laboratory&mdash;problems of recalibration, necessary compensatory
adjustments in the Avatar persona-transplant system now that the
donor body will not be Mangu's&mdash;and therefore she is too tired
in the evenings to want company. But he suspects she is avoiding him.
Crowfoot has always been at her most sociable when she is most
overworked; it is her escape from pressure. Shadrach does not know
why she would want to avoid him. Surely the night he spent with Katya
Lindman has nothing to do with it. He has been to bed with Lindman
before, and with others; Crowfoot too has had other partners; such
things have never mattered between them. It baffles him. When they
speak by telephone Nikki is wary and aloof. Beyond doubt something
has gone wrong in their relationship, but he has no theories.</P>
<P>A new Genghis Mao crisis distracts him briefly
from these matters. For the past several days the Khan has been
leaving his bed to work in his office, to visit Surveillance Vector
One, to direct the Committee activities from the headquarters room.
His recuperation was proceeding so smoothly that there seemed no
reason to confine him. But now Dr. Mordecai's sensitive implants are
picking up early warnings of trouble&mdash;epigastric pulsations,
faint systolic murmur, general circulatory stress. Too much activity
too soon? Shadrach goes to the Chairman's office to discuss the
problem. But Genghis Mao, still busy with his Mangu monuments and his
roundup of assassins, does not feel like conferring with his doctor,
does not want to talk about symptoms. He brushes Shadrach's queries
aside with a brusque declaration that he has rarely felt better. Then
he turns back to his desk. The arrests, he tells Mordecai proudly,
now total two hundred eighty-two. Of these, ninety-seven have already
been found guilty and sent to the organ farms. &quot;Soon,&quot; the
Khan says, &quot;the lungs and kidneys and intestines of these
criminals will serve to extend the lives of loyal members of the
government. Is there not poetic justice in that? All things are
centripetal, Shadrach. All opposites are reconciled.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Two hundred eighty-two conspirators?&quot;
Shadrach asks. &quot;Did it take that many to push one man out one
window?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Who knows? The actual crime perhaps required
no more than two or three perpetrators. But a great network of
subordinate plotters must have been needed. Security devices had to
be altered, guards distracted, cameras deflected. We believe it may
have taken a dozen conspirators simply to remove the bodies of the
killers from the plaza after they jumped.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;To do what?&quot;</P>
<P>Genghis Mao smiles blandly. &quot;We believe,&quot;
he says, &quot;that the assassins, after hurling Mangu from the
window, deliberately jumped from the same window themselves to keep
from being captured in the building. Confederates in the plaza
immediately gathered up their bodies and drove off with them, while
others removed all signs of their deaths from the pavement.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Shadrach stares. &quot;Horthy saw only one man
falling, sir.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Horthy did not remain in the plaza to
observe further developments.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Even so&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;If the killers of Mangu did <I>not </I>leap
after him,&quot; the Khan says, eyes bright with the brightness of
reason triumphant, &quot;what did become of them? No suspicious
persons were found in the tower after the crime.&quot;</P>
<P>Shadrach is unable to find an appropriate reply to
this. No comment he might make, he suspects, would be constructive.
After a pause he says, clearing his throat, &quot;Sir, if we could
talk about your health again for a moment&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I told you. I feel fine.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The symptoms I've begun to detect are fairly
serious ones, sir.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&quot;Symptoms of what?&quot; Genghis Mao snaps.</P>
<P>Shadrach suspects that the Khan may be developing
an aneurysm of the abdominal aorta&mdash;a defect in the wall of the
great vessel that conveys blood from the heart. He asks Genghis Mao
if he has felt any unusual discomfort, and the Chairman grudgingly
admits recent sharp pains in the back and sides. Dr. Mordecai does
not point out how this contradicts Genghis Mao's claim of being in
good health; but the admission does give Shadrach the upper hand, and
he orders the Chairman back to bed for rest.</P>
<P>Peering through the eye of a fiber probe extending
into Genghis Mao's catheterized aorta, Shadrach confirms his
diagnosis. The recent liver surgery, perhaps, has released emboli
into the Chairman's bloodstream, and one has somehow made its way
against the arterial flow, lodging in the abdominal aorta and causing
infection. Or perhaps not, but at any rate a tumor is taking form,
and more surgery will be necessary. If it were anyone else, the risks
of an operation so soon after a major organ transplant might be even
greater than the risks of letting the aneurysm expand. But Shadrach
has become amazingly casual about delivering up his venerable patient
to the knife. Genghis Mao's resilient body has been opened so often
that it accepts frequent surgery as the natural state. Besides, the
aneurysm is not far from the liver, and Warhaftig will be able to
enter through the recent incision, which is only now beginning to
heal.</P>
<P>The news annoys Genghis Mao. &quot;I have no time
for surgery now,&quot; he says, irritated. &quot;We're still finding
new conspirators everyday. I must give my full attention to the
problem. And next week is Mangu's stale funeral, at which I intend to
preside in person, I&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The danger is critical, sir.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You always tell me that. I think you enjoy
telling me that. You're too insecure, Shadrach. Even if you didn't
manage to find some new crisis every few weeks I'd still keep you on
the payroll. I <I>like </I>you, Shadrach.&quot; 
</P>
<P>I don't invent the crises, sir.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Even so. Can't this wait a month or two?&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;We'd have to make a fresh cut in healed
tissue then.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;What of it? What's one more slice?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Aside from that, the risks&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes,&quot; Genghis Mao says. &quot;The
risks. What risks do I run by letting this thing sit?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Do you know what an aneurysm is, sir?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;More or less.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It's a tumor containing blood or a blood
clot, in direct contact with the wall of an artery and causing
deteriorative changes in the tissue surrounding it. Think of it as a
balloon, gradually being inflated. When balloons get too big, they
explode.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Ah.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Eventually this aneurysm could rupture&mdash;into
the intestines, the peritoneum, the pleura, or the retroperitoneal
tissues. Or it might cause an embolism of the superior mesenteric
artery, producing intestinal infarction. The aorta itself could
rupture spontaneously. There are several other possibilities. All
fatal.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Fatal?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Invariably fatal. Agonizing pain, death
usually within minutes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah,&quot; Genghis Mao says. &quot;Ah. I
see.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;It could come at almost any time.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Ah.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Without warning.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I see.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;We'd be helpless, once the aneurysm goes. No
way of saving you, sir.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Ah. I see. Ah.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Does he see? Yes. Certainly, visions of erupting
aneurysms are floating before Genghis Mao's basilisk eyes. The lean
leathery cheeks contract in profound speculation; somber frowns
furrow the bronze forehead. The Khan is troubled. He had not planned
on being confronted with potential extinction this morning. Now,
obviously, he contemplates the going of Genghis II Mao IV Khan from
the world, and likes the idea no more than ever. The Permanent
Revolution that has transformed the aching world requires a Permanent
Leader; though Genghis Mao has often said, echoing Mao I's similar
words, that when one participates in a revolution one attains
revolutionary immortality, one transcends the death of the individual
by living on indefinitely within the permanent revolutionary ferment
one has helped to create, it is plain that Genghis Mao prefers the
other, less metaphorical species of immortality for himself. He
glowers. He sighs. He gives his consent to this latest surgical
interruption of his revolutionary labors.</P>
<P>Warhaftig is summoned. There are conferences;
schedules are rearranged; details of the surgery are explained to the
Khan. The blood vessels will be clamped above and below the aneurysm
to arrest circulation temporarily while Warhaftig removes the
aneurysm and installs a dacron or teflon prosthesis.</P>
<P>&quot;No,&quot; the Khan says. &quot;Not a
prosthesis. You can use a tissue graft, can't you? There's not much
of a rejection problem with arterial tissue. It's like stitching in a
length of hose.&quot;</P>
<P>Warhaftig says, &quot;But dacron and teflon have
proven perfectly &mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No. I have enough plastic in me already. And
the organ banks are overflowing with new material. Give me real
aorta.'' Genghis Mao's eyes gleam. &quot;Give me aorta from one of
the recently convicted conspirators.&quot;</P>
<P>Warhaftig looks at Shadrach Mordecai, who shrugs.</P>
<P>&quot;As you wish,&quot; the surgeon says.</P>
<P>Shadrach has lunch soon afterward with Katya
Lindman. When they have eaten, they stroll in Sukhe Bator Square. He
has spent more time than usual with Lindman since the night they went
to Karakorum, although he has not slept with her again. He finds her
more gentle, less threatening now, and is not sure whether she has
changed or simply his attitude toward her; waking up and finding her
sobbing may have had something to do with it. Certainly she has
become warm and friendly, so much so that he suspects and fears she
may even be falling in love with him; yet there is something reserved
at her core, some ineluctable holding back, a zone of silence within
her that strikes him as the enemy of love. There never were such
sealed places in Nikki Crowfoot when Shadrach's relationship with her
was going well.</P>
<P>The midday sun is bright, the air soft, the day
warm; golden flowers gleam in the terra-cotta tubs of shrubbery that
decorate the plaza. Katya walks close to him, but their bodies do not
touch. She has already heard of the new crisis. News of all sorts
travels inordinately swiftly through the Grand Tower of the Khan, but
especially news of the health of Genghis Mao. &quot;Tell me what an
aneurysm is,&quot; she says. He gives her an elaborate explanation
and describes the operation that will be performed. They are standing
near the place where Mangu fell. When he finishes, Shadrach looks up
and tries to imagine two or three assassins plummeting in Mangu's
wake, while lurking confederates spring forth to sweep up the
shattered bodies and escape with them. Madness, Shadrach thinks. And
this is the carefully considered theory propounded in all seriousness
by the ruler of the world. Madness. Madness.</P>
<P>He says, &quot;There've been almost three hundred
arrests so far. Ninety-seven sent to the organ farms. Last week Roger
Buckmaster was alive, healthy, his own master as much as any of us
is. Tomorrow we may be using his aorta to patch Genghis Mao's. And
still the arrests continue.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;So I gather. Avogadro's men bring them in,
day and night. When will the Khan be satisfied?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;When he decides that all the conspirators
have been caught, I suppose.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Conspirators!&quot; Katya says scathingly.
For a moment she has the old frightening intensity again. &quot;What
conspirators? What conspiracy? The whole thing is insane. Mangu
killed himself.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You think it was suicide too, then?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot; Think? I know it was,&quot; she says in a
low voice, turning away from the Grand Tower as though to avoid
cameras that might read her lips.</P>
<P>&quot;You talk as if you were there when he
jumped.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Don't be silly.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;How can you know it was suicide, then?&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;I know. I know.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot; <I>Were </I>you there when he&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Of course not,&quot; Lindman says.</P>
<P>&quot;Then why are you so sure you're right?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Good reasons. Sufficient reasons.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You know something that the security people
don't?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes,&quot; she says.</P>
<P>&quot;Then why don't you speak up about it, before
Avogadro arrests the whole world?&quot;</P>
<P>She is silent a moment. &quot;No,&quot; she says
at last. &quot;I can't. It would destroy me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I don't follow.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You would if I told you the story.&quot; She
studies him. &quot;If I told you, would it stop with you?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;If that's what you wanted.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I feel I should tell someone. I'd like to
tell you. I trust you, Shadrach. But I'm afraid.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;If you'd rather not&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No. No. I'll tell you. Walk with me across
the plaza. Keep your back to the tower.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There are cameras everywhere. It doesn't
matter which way we face. But they can't pick up everything, I
guess.&quot;</P>
<P>They start across the plaza. Lindman raises her
arm, holding it across her face as though to scratch her nose with
the back of her wrist, and says, mouth covered, voice muffled, &quot;I
saw Mangu the night before he jumped. We talked about Project Avatar.
I told him be was going to be the donor.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, Jesus. You didn't!&quot;</P>
<P>She nods grimly. &quot;I couldn't keep it to
myself any longer. It was a Monday night, just before Genghis Mao's
liver transplant, right? Yes. Mangu had made a speech that night,
something about worldwide distribution of the Antidote. Then he and I
went for drinks somewhere. He was afraid Genghis Mao might die during
the operation and he'd have to take charge of things&mdash;<I>I'm not
ready, </I>Mangu kept saying, <I>I'm not ready. </I>And then we
started talking about the three projects, and he began to speculate
about Avatar. What his role would likely be in the government if they
transplanted Genghis Mao's mind into some other body. Whether Genghis
Mao would still want him as viceroy after the transition, things like
that. It was so sad, Shadrach, so fucking sad, so filthy sad, the way
he kept poking at it, trying to figure out what was in store for him,
working up all sorts of hypotheses and scenarios. Finally I couldn't
stand it and I told him to stop worrying about it, that he was
wasting his time, that after the transition he wasn't going to be
around, that Genghis Mao was going to use his body as the donor.&quot;</P>
<P>Shadrach is stunned by this confession. He can
barely speak; his legs tremble, his skin is chilled. He says, &quot;How
could you have done it?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;The words just came out. I mean, here was
this man, this pitiful doomed man trying to understand his future,
trying to see what his role would be, and I knew that he had no
future. Not if Project Avator worked out. We all knew it, all but
him. And I couldn't hold it back any longer.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;What happened than?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;His face seemed to cave in. His eyes went
dead&mdash;blank&mdash; empty. He sat for a long time and didn't say
anything. Then he asked me how I knew. I said it was known to a lot
of people. He asked if you knew and I said I thought so. I want to
talk to Nikki Crowfoot, he said. She's at Karakorum with Shadrach, I
told him. Then he asked me if I thought Avatar really would work out,
and I said I didn't know, I had a lot of faith in my own project,
with any luck Talos would head Avatar off. It's all a matter of time,
I said. Avatar's ahead of Talos now, and if anything serious happens
to Genghis Mao in the next few months they might have to activate
Avatar, because the Talos automation needs at least a year of further
development work and Project Pheonix isn't getting anywhere. He
thought about that. He said it didn't matter to him whether he
actually became the donor or not, the thing was that Genghis Mao had
let him think he was the heir-apparent while secretly approving what
amounted to his murder. That was what hurt, he said, not the idea of
dying, not the idea of giving up his body to Genghis Mao, but being
tricked, being treated like a simpleton. And then he got up, he said
goodnight, he went out. Walking very slowly. After that I don't know.
I suppose he spent the whole night thinking things over. Thinking
about how he had been duped. The prize lamb, fattened for the
slaughter. And in the morning he jumped.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And in the morning he jumped,&quot; Shadrach
says. &quot;Yes. Yes. It sounds right. Some truths can't be faced.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;So there are no conspirators. The conspiracy
exists only in Genghis Mao's paranoia. Those three hundred arrested
people are innocent. How many sent to the organ farms so far?
Ninety-seven? Innocent. All innocent. I've watched it happen, but
there's nothing I can do. I can't speak out. They say the Khan
refuses even to consider the suicide hypothesis.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;He wants there to have been a conspiracy,
yes,&quot; Shadrach says. &quot;He enjoys punishing the guilty.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And if I told him what I've just told you,
the Khan would have me killed.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You'd be in the organ farm tomorrow. Yes. Or
else maybe he'd pick you as the new Avatar donor.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No,&quot; Katya says. &quot;That isn't
likely.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It would suit his philosophy. It would be
very centripetal, wouldn't it? Your loose tongue costs him Mangu's
body, so you become Mangu's replacement. Very fitting. Very neat.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Don't be foolish, Shadrach. It's
unimaginable. He's a barbarian, isn't he? He's a Mongol. He thinks
he's the reincarnation of Genghis Khan. He'd never let himself be
transplanted into a woman's body.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why not? The old Mongol khans weren't
sexists, Katya. As I recall, the Mongols let themselves be ruled by
female regents now and then when the male line gave out. Of course,
there are problems of adaptation he'd have, changing sexes, all the
bodily reflexes, all the million little masculine things that he'd
have to unlearn&mdash;</P>
<P>&quot;Stop it, Shadrach. It isn't a serious
possibility, the Khan's taking my body.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But it's amusing to consider&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It doesn't amuse me.&quot; She halts and
swings around to face him. She is pale, drawn, tense. &quot;What can
we do? How can we stop these hideous arrests?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There's no way. The thing has to run its
course.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Suppose an anonymous tip is sent to the
Khan, telling him merely that Mangu had learned what was in store for
him, that some unnamed person had revealed to him that he would be
used for&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No. Either Genghis Mao will ignore it, or
else he'll begin a vast and bloody interrogation of everybody who
might have had knowledge of the Avatar plan.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What if the arrests don't stop though?&quot;</P>
<P>Shadrach says, &quot;Avogadro's running out of
suspects. It's almost over.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And the prisoners awaiting sentence?&quot; 
</P>
<P>Shadrach Mordecai sighs. &quot;We can't help them.
They are lost. Nothing can be done, Katya. One way or another, we're
all awaiting sentence.&quot;</P>
<P>He is haunted all afternoon by the vision of
Mangu, pitiful deluded Mangu, stripped of all delusions, confronted
at last by frosty reality. Why had Lindman tipped him to his true
fate? Out of compassion? Did she really think she was helping him,
for God's sake? Had she thought that receiving such knowledge could
do Mangu any good? Could she have failed to see how cruel, how
merciless, she was being? No. She must have known that a man like
Mangu, genial, shallow, unquestioning, a man who was living an
impossible fantasy of eventual succession to the world's most
powerful office, believing he enjoyed the esteem, even the love, of
Genghis Mao, would collapse totally if that structure of fantasy was
ripped away. <I>She must have known.</I></P>
<P>Of course. An hour after lunching with Katya
Lindman, Shadrach finally grasps the pattern. Lindman, good
chessplayer that she is, had foreseen all the consequences of her
move. Tell Mangu the truth, pretending compassion and claiming a
compulsion to frankness. Mangu&mdash;out of humiliation, chagrin,
fear, even vengefulness, whatever&mdash;reacts by putting his body
beyond Genghis Mao's reach. No Mangu, and Project Avatar is dealt a
mighty blow. Nikki, Lindman's rival, is discomfited; Avatar, set back
by many months, loses its primacy to Lindman's Project Talos;
Shadrach, already mysteriously estranged from Nikki, is drawn
inevitably closer to Katya as her star rises. Of course. Of course.
And all the rest, Katya's pretense of concern for the hapless victims
of the mass arrests, Katya's show of grief for poor pathetic
Mangu&mdash;all part of the game. Shadrach shivers. Even in the harsh
and perverse climate of the Grand Tower of the Khan, this seems
monstrous, and Lindman a baleful and alien figure, malevolent enough
to make a suitable consort for Genghis Mao himself. Or, if not a
mate, then a fitting housing for the old ogre's devious and sinister
mind. Yes! For a moment Shadrach does seriously consider urging the
Khan to take Lindman's body in place of Mangu's: <I>An appropriate
choice, sir, very centripetal, very apt. </I>Though he is puzzled by
one still-obscure motive: why has Lindman revealed all this to him?
If she is so calculating a monster, would she not have calculated the
likelihood that he would sooner or later come to see her for what she
is? Can that have been her ultimate aim? Why? He is dizzied by the
multiplicity of speculations.</P>
<P>He wants to turn to Nikki, but Nikki has continued
to hold herself aloof, and he has not even spoken to her by telephone
for two or three days. He phones her now, on the pretext that he
needs an update on Project Avatar progress, but one of her assistants
appears on the screen, a Dr. Eis from Frankfurt. Eis, classically
Teutonic, pale blue eyes and soft golden hair, does an odd little
take of&mdash;surprise? dismay? distaste?&mdash;at the sight of
Shadrach, forehead furrowing and corner of mouth pulling in, but he
recovers quickly and gives him a cool, formal greeting. Shadrach
says, &quot;May I speak with Dr. Crowfoot, please?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'm sorry. Dr. Crowfoot is not here. Perhaps
I can be of assis&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Will she be back this afternoon?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Dr. Crowfoot has left for the day. Dr.
Mordecai.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I need to reach her.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;She is in her apartment, Doctor. An illness.
She has asked that she not be disturbed.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Sick? What's me matter?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;A mild upset. A fever, headaches. She has
asked me to tell you, if you called the laboratory, that we are still
studying the recalibration problem, but that at present there is
nothing to report, no&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P><I>&quot;Danke, </I>Dr. Eis.&quot;</P>
<P><I>&quot;Bitte, </I>Dr. Mordecai,&quot; Eis
replies crisply, as Shadrach blanks the screen.</P>
<P>He starts to phone Nikki's apartment. No. He's had
enough of evasions, excuses, procrastinations, deflections. It's too
easy for her to run numbers like that when he calls. He'll simply go
down there and ring the doorbell, uninvited.</P>
<P>She lets him stand in the hallway a long time
before she responds, though she must know, from her doorscreen, who's
there. Then she says, &quot;What do you want, Shadrach?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Eis told me you were ill.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It's nothing serious. Just a bad case of the
lousies.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;May I come in?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'm trying to take a nap, Shadrach.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I won't stay long.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But I feel so awful. I'd rather not have
visitors.&quot; 
</P>
<P>He starts to turn away from the door, but,
although he knows his maniac persistence can do him no good, he finds
it loo painful to leave without seeing her. Helplessly he hears
himself saying, &quot; At least let me see if I can prescribe
something for you, Nikki. I <I>am </I>a doctor, after all.&quot;</P>
<P>Long silence. Desperately he prays that no one he
knows will come upon him here, out in the hall like a lovesick Romeo
pleading to be let in.</P>
<P>The door opens, at last.</P>
<P>She is in bed, and she really does look sick, face
flushed and feverish, eyes bloodshot. The air in the bedroom has that
stale sickroom quality, stuffy and congested. He goes at once to open
the window; Crowfoot shivers and asks him not to, but he ignores her.
He sees when she sits up that she is naked under her blanket. &quot;I'll
find your pajamas for you if you're cold,&quot; he says.</P>
<P>&quot;No. I hate wearing pajamas. I don't know if
I'm cold or hot.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;May I examine you?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I'm not all that sick, Shadrach.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Even so, I'd like to make certain.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You think I'm coming down with organ-rot?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There's no harm in checking things out,
Nikki. It'll take only a moment.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Pity you can't diagnose me the way you do
Genghis Mao, just by reading your own internal gadgets. Without
having to bother me at all.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, I can't,&quot; he says. &quot;But
this'll be quick.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;All right,&quot; she tells him. She has not
once met his eyes during this interchange, and that bothers him. &quot;Go
ahead. Play doctor with me, if you have to.&quot;</P>
<P>He uncovers her, and finds himself curiously
reticent about exposing her body this way, as though their recent
estrangement has somehow deprived him of a doctor's traditional
privileges. But of course he has had only one patient in his career,
having gone straight from medical school to the service of Genghis
Mao, having done nothing but gerontological research until being
elevated to serve as the Khan's personal physician, and he has never
developed the practicing doctor's traditional indifference to flesh:
this is no anonymous patient, this is Nikki Crowfoot whom he loves,
and her naked body is more than an object to him. After a moment he
attains some impersonality, though, transforms her breasts into mere
globes of meat, her thighs into sexless columns of flesh and muscle,
and checks her over without further unsettling himself, reading her
pulse, tapping her chest, palpating her abdomen, all the routine
things. Her self-diagnosis turns out to have been accurate: no
incipient organ-rot, just a trifling upset, some fever, nothing
remarkable. Plenty of fluids, rest, a couple of pills, and she'll be
back to normal in a day or so.</P>
<P>&quot;Satisfied?&quot; she asks mockingly.</P>
<P>&quot;Is it so hard for you to accept the fact
lhat I worry about you, Nikki?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I told you I didn't have anything serious.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I still worried.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;So examining me was really therapy for you?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I suppose,&quot; he admits.</P>
<P>&quot;And if you hadn't rushed over to give me the
benefit of your high-powered medical skills, I might be asleep now.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I'm sorry.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;All right, Shadrach.&quot;</P>
<P>She turns away from him, curling up sullenly under
the bedclothes. He stands by the bed, silent, wanting to ask a
thousand unaskable questions, wanting to know what shadow has fallen
between them, why she has become so mysteriously remote, so cool, why
she will not even look straight at him when she speaks to him. After
a moment he says, instead, &quot;How's the project going?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Didn't Eis speak to you? We're
recalibrating. It'll take us a while to gear up for a new donor. The
whole thing's a colossal pain in the ass.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;How much of a setback is it, actually?&quot;</P>
<P>She shrugs. &quot;A month, if we're lucky. Or
three.Or six. It all depends.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;On what?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;On&mdash;on&mdash;oh, Christ! Look,
Shadrach, I don't really want to talk shop right now. I feel sick. Do
you know what being sick means? My head hurts. My belly hurts. My
skin tingles. I want to get some rest. I don't want to discuss my
current research problems.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; he says again.</P>
<P>&quot;Will you go now?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes. Yes. I'll phone you in the morning to
see how you're coming along, okay?&quot;</P>
<P>She mutters something into her pillow.</P>
<P>He starts to leave. But he makes one last attempt
to reach her before he goes. At the door he says tamely, &quot;Oh&mdash;have
you heard the newest rumor making the rounds? About Mangu's death?&quot;</P>
<P>She groans stoically. &quot;I haven't heard
anything. But go on. Go on. What is it?&quot;</P>
<P>He frames his words carefully, so that he will not
feel he is breaching Katya Lindman's confidence: &quot;The story
that's going around is that Mangu committed suicide because somebody
connected with Project Talos tipped him that he was to be the Avatar
donor.&quot;</P>
<P>Nikki sits upright, eyes wide, face animated,
cheeks blazing in excitement.</P>
<P>&quot;What? What? I hadn't heard that!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It's just a story.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Who's the one who's supposed to have tipped
him?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;They don't say.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Lindman herself, was it?&quot; Nikki
demands.</P>
<P>&quot;It's only a rumor, Nikki. Nobody specific
has been named. Anyway, Katya wouldn't do anything so
unprofessional.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh no?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I don't think so. If it happened at all, it
was probably some ambitious underling, some third-echelon programmer.
If it happened at all. There may not be a shred of truth to it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But it <I>sounds </I>right,&quot; she says.
Her breasts are heaving, her skin is glossy with new sweat. &quot;What
better way could Lindman find to sabotage my work? Oh, why didn't I
think of it! How could I not have seen&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Stay calm, Nikki. You aren't well.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;When I get hold of her&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Please,&quot; Shadrach says. &quot;Lie down.
I wish I hadn't said a word. You know what sort of wild rumors go
floating around this building. I absolutely don't believe that Katya
would&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;We'll see,&quot; she says ominously. She
grows more calm. &quot;You may be right. Even so. Even so. We should
have had much tighter security. However many people knew that Mangu
was the donor, five, six, ten people, that was too many. Much too
many. For the next donor&mdash;&quot; Crowfoot coughs. She turns away
again, huddling into her pillow. &quot;Oh, Shadrach, I feel lousy! Go
away! Please go away! Now you've got me all stirred up over something
altogether new, and I&mdash;oh, Shadrach&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; he says once more. &quot;I
didn't mean&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Goodbye, Shadrach.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Goodbye, Nikki.&quot;</P>
<P>He bolts from the apartment. He plunges through
the hall, fetching up finally against a stanchion near the stairs. He
grasps it, steadies himself. The visit to Nikki has hardly improved
his state of mind. Her attitude toward him, he realizes, ranged from
indifferent to irritated; never once did she express any pleasure
that he had come to see her. He was tolerated at best.</P>
<P>And now, he knows, he must hurry back to Katya.</P>
<P>She seemed surprised to see him again so soon. She
greets him warmly, unsubtly, as though automatically assuming he has
come here to make love. His mood is far from sexual, though. He
disengages himself from her embrace as soon as is politic, and gently
but firmly establishes a psychic distance between them. In quick
earnest blurts he reports the essence of his conversation with Nikki,
stressing that the &quot;rumor&quot; he had invented did not in any
way incriminate Katya herself in the tipping off of Mangu.</P>
<P>&quot;But of course Crowfoot immediately guessed I
was the one, right?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I'm afraid so. I argued that it was
inconceivable you'd do any such thing, but she&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Now she knows I did, and will hold the
grudge against me forever, and will do whatever she can to pay me
back. Thanks a lot.&quot;</P>
<P>Quietly Shadrach says, &quot;If she's angry, you
can't entirely blame her. You have to admit there was an aspect of
sabotaging Avatar in your passing the word to Mangu.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I passed the word to Mangu out of pity for
him,&quot; Lindman says flintily.</P>
<P>&quot;Pity and nothing but pity? You didn't
consider at all that he might react in a way that would upset the
Avatar program, and that that would create problems for Nikki
Crowfoot?&quot; Katya is silent for some while.</P>
<P>At length she says, in a more yielding voice, &quot;I
suppose that that crossed my mind too. But it was very secondary.
Very very secondary. Mainly I couldn't bear to face Mangu any more,
listening to him talking about his future and knowing what I knew. I
had to warn him or I'd saddle myself with full responsibility for
what was going to happen to him, Can you believe that, Shadrach? How
evil do you think I am? Do you think my life begins and ends with
these insane projects of Genghis Mao's? Do you think that the only
motivations that operate in me are Talos motivations, how I can push
my own career, how I can wreck Nikki Crowfoot's? Do you?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I don't know. I suppose not.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You suppose?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I don't think you're like that, no.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Fine. Splendid. Thank you. And what happens
now? Will she denounce me to Genghis Mao?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There's no proof you ever said anything to
Mangu,&quot; Shadrach Mordecai replies. &quot;She knows that. She
knows also that whatever accusations she makes against you will be
discounted as professional jealousy. I don't think she'll take any
action at all, actually. Except that she did say she'd maintain
tighter security on the identity of the <I>next </I>Avatar donor, so
that there'd be no chance the same thing would&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It's too late,&quot; Lindman says.</P>
<P>&quot;The next donor's already been picked?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And you know his name?&quot;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&quot;I don't suppose you'd care to tell me,&quot;
Shadrach says.</P>
<P>&quot;I don't think I should.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Are you planning to tell <I>him?&quot;</I></P>
<P>&quot;Would you say it was sabotage again if I
did?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It depends on the circumstances, I guess.
Who is he?&quot;</P>
<P>Katya Lindman trembles. Her lips quiver.</P>
<P>&quot;You,&quot; she says.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3><I>15</I></H3>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>It seems like a joke, and not a very good joke. He
is unable to accept it at all, despite the strident note of
conviction in Katya's voice, that shrill, almost desperate note of
certainty that Shadrach had also heard when Roger Buckmaster was
trying to deny his complicity in Mangu's death, that tone that says.
<I>You won't believe this no matter how heavy an oath I swear, but
what I'm telling you is true, is true, is true, is true!</I></P>
<P>Yet if he <I>has </I>been selected as the new
donor, it would explain why Nikki has been avoiding him, why she is
remote and short-tempered when they speak, why her eyes will not meet
his&mdash;</P>
<P>&quot;No,&quot; he says. &quot;I don't believe
you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;So don't believe me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It's absurd, Katya.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Undoubtedly it's absurd. And it'll be just
as absurd the day they come for you and put the electrodes on your
head and obliterate every trace of Shadrach Mordecai and pour the
soul of Genghis Mao into your pretty brown body.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;My pretty brown body,&quot; Shadrach says,
&quot;is full og complicated and irreplaceable medical devices that
register every twitch of Genghis Mao's metabolism. It took Roger
Buckmaster a couple of years to design and build that system, it took
Warhaftig weeks to implant it in me, it took me a year to learn how
to use it. Using it, I can protect Genghis Mao's health in a way that
was never before possible in medical history. With all the warm
bodies Avatar has to choose from, do you think Genghis Mao would let
them choose the one body that's indispensable to his&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Think, Shadrach, <I>think. </I>Avatar won't
be activated unless Genghis Mao's present body is on the threshold of
death. He won't <I>need </I>all your fancy implants once he moves
into your body. He won't need you as his doctor; he won't really need
a full-time doctor at all, not for many years. And he can find
another doctor. He can find another Buckmaster to build a new set of
implants when the time comes. He's probably got a replacement for you
in training already, somewhere in Bulgaria or Afghanistan. Remember
what he always says about redundancy, Shadrach? The avenue of
survival. Genghis Mao understands survival very well. Better than
you, I'm afraid.&quot;</P>
<P>Shadrach Mordecai's mouth opens. Says nothing.
Closes.</P>
<P>&quot;If Avatar is activated,&quot; Katya says,
&quot;you go. I swear it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;When was this decided?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;More than a week ago. I found out about it a
few hours before we left for Karakorum.&quot;</P>
<P>Which was just about the time Nikki Crowfoot began
finding excuses for not keeping company with him, Shadrach reflects.
He remembers waking up in this very room, Katya's room, the night of
the dream-death excursion, and discovering Katya sobbing beside him
in bed, and hearing her tell him that she was afraid for him, without
offering further explanation. Yes. And he remembers all that lunatic
talk of Genghis Mao's about nominating him for Pope, for King of
England&mdash;what was that about? Disguised and displaced
intimations of the real nomination? He remembers, too, and the memory
chills him, running shirtless into Genghis Mao's bedroom just after
the news of Mangu's death had broken, remembers seeing the Khan
eyeing his bare torso with interest, with admiration, Genghis Mao
saying. <I>You look very healthy, Shadrach. </I>Yes. Shopping for a
new body already, was he, minutes after learning of the loss of
Mangu?</P>
<P>He thinks of Buckmaster screaming, <I>You'll
finish in the furnace, Shadrach, in the furnace, in the bloody
furnace!</I></P>
<P>No. No. No.</P>
<P>&quot;I can't believe this,&quot; he says.</P>
<P>&quot;Start learning how.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It makes no sense to me. I literally can't
grasp the meaning of the whole thing.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Doesn't it frighten you, Shadrach?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No. Not at all.&quot; He holds out his
hands. Steady. As steady as Warhaftig's. &ldquo;See? I'm entirely
calm. I am without affect. It doesn't register on me. It's unreal.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But it isn't, Shadrach.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Nikki knows?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Of course.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;She's not the one who picked me, is she?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Genghis Mao picked you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes. That figures. Yes.&quot; He laughs. &quot;Do
you notice how I begin to talk as though I believe this? As though I
accept it, on some level?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What will you do, Shadrach?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Do? Do? What should I do? Should I do what
Mangu did?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You're not Mangu.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No,&quot; he says. &quot;Even if I had
absolute proof, even if they came to me with an engraved scroll
signed by Genghis Mao, nominating me for Avatar, I wouldn't choose
Mangu's way. I'm not in the least a suicidal person. Maybe it sets in
later, Katya. First I have to feel something. I don't feel anything
yet. I don't feel betrayed, I don't feel endangered, I don't think I
even feel surprised.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Could it be that you want to be the Avatar
donor?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I want to be Dr. Shadrach Mordecai. I want
to go on being him for a long time.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Then keep Genghis Mao healthy. So long as
his body is functioning, he won't need yours. Meanwhile, it'll be my
task to make Avatar altogether superfluous by bringing Talos quickly
to perfection. You know, Genghis Mao may actually prefer the Talos
idea. I think it suits his particular brand of paranoia to be
transferred into a machine, an imperishable, flawless machine. After
all, even your beautiful body is going to decay and crumble. He knows
that. He knows he might have twenty or thirty good years in you, and
then it'll be the same route all over again, organ transplants,
drugs, constant surgery, whereas the Talos simulacrum will spare him
all that. So Avatar is just a contingency plan for him, a redundancy
that he hopes not to have to use, and that's why he can pick people
he values as the donors&mdash; Mangu, you&mdash;a kind of honor, in
its way, the blessing of the Khan, not at all the jeopardy that it
might be thought to be. I tried to tell that to Mangu, too, that
Avatar wouldn't necessarily happen, but he&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why did you tell me about this, Katya?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;For the same reason I told Mangu.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;To help wreck Avatar?&quot;</P>
<P>Her eyes flash the old Lindman fire. &quot;Don't
be a bastard. Do you think I want you to jump out a window too?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What good is it, telling me?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I want you to be on guard, Shadrach. I want
you to know what danger you're in now. So long as there's even a
slight likelihood that Avatar will have to be used, you&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What does it matter to you, though ? A sore
conscience? You don't like hanging out with men who you know are
secretly earmarked for destruction?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That's part of it,&quot; Katya says quietly.
&quot;I hate living a lie.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What's the rest?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I love you,&quot; she says.</P>
<P>He stares with glassy eyes. &quot;What?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I'm not capable of it? I'm good only for
building automations, is that it? I have no emotions?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&quot;I didn't mean that. But&mdash;you seemed so
cold all the time, so businesslike, so matter-of-fact. Even when&mdash;&quot;
He pauses, decides to finish. &quot;Even when we would have sex. I
never felt any emotional warmth from you; only, well, physical
passion.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You were Nikki's. Getting involved with you
would only have been painful to me. You didn't want me except for the
occasional fling in Karakorum, except for the occasional meaningless
screw.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And now?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Do you still love Nikki? She helped sell you
out, you know. She went to Genghis Mao, she heard him select you for
Avatar, she probably tried to get him to change his mind&mdash;we
ought to give her that much credit&mdash;and she failed, and then she
accepted the order. Her career comes before your life. She could have
come to you and said. <I>This is what Genghis Mao wants to do, but I
can't do it, I rebel, let's both get out of this hideous place. </I>She
didn't, though, did she? She simply started keeping away from you.
Because of the guilt she felt, right? Not out of love, but out of
guilt, out of shame.&quot;</P>
<P>Numbly Shadrach shakes his head.</P>
<P>&quot;This is unreal, Katya.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I have told you no lies today.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But Nikki&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Is afraid of Genghis Mao. As am I, as are
you, as is everyone in this city, everyone in the world. That's the
measure of her love for you: her fear of that crazy old man is
greater. If I'd been in her position, I might have made the same
choice. But it's not my project. I'm not faced with the option of
betraying you versus defying the Khan. I'm free to go behind his
back, to warn you, to let you make your own decisions. But it's
strange, isn't it? The warm tall beautiful loving Nikki agrees to
sell you out. And the bitter vengeful squat ugly Katya risks her life
to warn you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You aren't ugly,&quot; he murmurs.</P>
<P>Katya laughs. &ldquo;Come here,'' she says. She
sits on the edge of the bed, tugs him down beside her, roughly
presses his head against her breasts. &quot;Rest. Think. Make plans,
Shadrach. You're lost if you don't.&quot; She caresses his aching
forehead.</P>
<P>They sit that way in silence for a long while.
Then, shakily, he rises, he removes his clothes, he gestures to her,
and she disrobes as well. He must operate on the Khan tomorrow, but
for once he does not let that matter to him. He reaches for her. He
covers her strangely submissive body with his own, locking his long
lean dark-skinned arms around her wide meaty shoulders, pushing his
thin bony chest into the soft cushion of her bosom, and her legs open
and he plunges deep within her, and stays like that, immobile,
gathering strength, pasting himself together, until at last he is
ready to move.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>The next day is the day of Genghis Mao's aorta
transplant. Shadrach, after the usual brief fitful sleep, awakens,
exercises, breakfasts, dresses, negotiates passage through Interface
Three, pauses to inspect the doings in the Trauma Ward by means of
Surveillance Vector One&mdash;the standard morning routine. The
dancing lenses display for him the world's two billion, perhaps
twenty percent of them stricken with organ-rot, the walking dead,
shambling about with perforations and lesions and corruptions, and
most of the others who are still whole living in the shadow of the
universal disease, going through a semblance of ordinary life with
sullen courage, waiting for the spitting of blood and the fire in the
guts, looking toward the demigods of Ulan Bator in envy and
bewilderment. While he, light-footed Shadrach Mordecai, the pretty
doctor of the Khan, has nothing worse to worry about than being
evicted from his own nimble body, being kicked out on his black ass
so that a Mongol usurper can move into his skull. Other than that,
Shadrach, everything's fine, right? Right. Yassuh, boss.</P>
<P>Shadrach wonders, as he goes to fetch Genghis Mao
for the traditional and familiar gurney ride from the imperial
bedchamber to the Surgery, how he will react when he comes face to
face with the Khan. Surely his expression will betray his new
knowledge; surely Genghis Mao, nearly ninety years canny, will see at
once that his designated victim is in on the scheme. But Shadrach
discovers that his mysterious tranquility of spirit does not desert
him even when he is eye to eye with the Khan. He feels nothing,
neither fear nor anger nor resentment: the Chairman is the patient,
he is the doctor, the sensors are twitching away, loading him with
information, and that's all, no change in their relation-ship. He
looks at Genghis Mao and thinks, <I>You have secretly plotted to
steal my body, </I>and there is no effect, none. It remains unreal to
him.</P>
<P>&quot;And how am I this morning, Shadrach?&quot;
Genghis Mao booms jovially.</P>
<P>&quot;Splendid, sir. Never better.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Going to cut out my heart, are you?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Only the aorta this time,&quot; Shadrach
says. He signals to the attendants. They wheel the Chairman away.</P>
<P>And there they all are once more gathered in the
Surgery&mdash;the Chairman, the physician, the chief surgeon, the
anesthesiologist, the nurses and other miscellaneous medical
spear-carriers, everyone scrubbed and gowned and masked, the bright
lights gleaming, the transparent aseptic bubble sealed, the filters
and pumps pumping and filtering, the computers flashing green and red
and yellow like gaudy movie props, the new aortal section&mdash;
Buckmaster's?&mdash;sitting in its container, fresh and plump, ready
to be installed in Genghis Mao's abdomen.</P>
<P>Warhaftig, confident, serene, prepares once more
to open the spare, slight body of Genghis Mao.</P>
<P>&quot;Blood pressure?&quot; he asks.</P>
<P>&quot;Normal,&quot; Shadrach says.</P>
<P>&quot;Respiration?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Normal.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Platelet count?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Normal. Normal. Everything normal.&quot;</P>
<P>Shadrach is aware that if Genghis Mao should die
on the operating table, there would be no Project Avatar to menace
him: none of the three projects is ready yet to be put into effect,
and if the Khan does not survive the transplant, that will be the end
of him, without hope of reincarnation, perhaps even the end of the
Permanent Revolutionary Committee, the entire fragile society of
centripetal depolarization polarizing and centrifuging into chaos the
instant the legendary figure of Genghis Mao vanishes from the scene.
It would not be hard to manage it. Jostle Warhaftig's elbow, maybe,
as he aims the surgical laser at the Chairman's guts; apologize
profusely afterward, but the damage will be done. Or, more subtly,
feed the operating team misleading information, cockeyed reports from
Genghis Mao's ostensible interior: they trust Dr. Mordecai, they will
follow his data without bothering to check it against the numbers on
the scopes and meters, and he could probably cause irreversible
injury to the Chairman, fatal oxygen shortage or the like, before
Warhaftig realizes what is taking place. And then the apologies, I
simply can't <I>understand </I>why my readings were off so badly. He
has no need to worry about a malpractice suit: topple the Khan and
the whole fabric comes apart, every man for himself in the aftermath.
But he will not. No harm will come to Genghis Mao by way of Shadrach
Mordecai today, not even if he knows the Khan intends to activate
Project Avatar before next Tuesday. Dr. Mordecai, in peril or not, is
nevertheless a doctor, a dedicated doctor, still young and naive
enough to take his Hippocratic oath seriously. He was sworn to keep
pure and holy both his life and his art. He has vowed to help the
sick and to abstain from all intentional wrongdoing and harm. So be
it. Shadrach Mordecai, MD, Harvard '01, is no traducer of sacred
trusts. Genghis Mao is his patient; Genghis Mao will not die at
Shadrach Mordecai's hands this day. Perhaps this is foolishness, but
there is also a certain grace in it.</P>
<P>The operation proceeds smoothly. Snip, and the
weakened section of Genghis Mao's aorta comes out. Stitch stitch, and
the replacement is grafted in. Heart-lung machines keep the
circulation bubbling. The Khan watches, conscious and beady-eyed,
through the whole thing, now and again nodding to himself as
Warhaftig executes some particularly admirable veronicas and
entrechats and passades. He seems to know what is going on; he has
spent more time observing surgeons at their trade than I have,
Shadrach realizes, and can probably do the job pretty well by himself
by now. Warhaftig's elegant fingers elegantly close the incision. The
tissues are raw and reddening, having been cut into for the liver
transplant less than two weeks earlier, and this calls for some
special prophylactic measures, but the surgeon brings everything off
with his customary finesse. Genghis Mao grins approval when all is
over. &quot;Good show,&quot; he tells Warhaftig. &quot;Two ears and
the tail!&quot;</P>
<P>Shadrach makes off with the Khan's discarded
abdominal aorta. He tells Warhaftig, not that Warhaftig cares, that
he intends to run some tests on it, but what tests would tell him
anything about this drooping length of ancient tissue, this tired
hose, that he doesn't already know? He covets it because it's an
authentic piece of the body of the authentic Genghis II Mao IV Khan,
and Shadrach has the collector's itch: this will be an ornament to
his little museum of medical memorabilia. A relic of one of history's
most famous patients. There is a tale Shadrach knows, probably
apocryphal, of how the doctor who performed the autopsy on Napoleon
removed the imperial penis and kept it as a souvenir of the late
emperor, bequeathing it to a fellow physician who ultimately sold it
at an immense price, and so on and on, passing from one doctor's
collection to another, until it disappeared altogether during the
confusions of some twentieth-century war. Similar stories, he knows,
have been told of odd scraps of Hitler, Stalin, George Washington,
Catherine the Great. Shadrach regrets that he attained his present
post too late to collect some of the really significant organs of
Genghis Mao&mdash;a kidney, say, or a lung, the liver, the
pancreas&mdash;but all of them were gone long before Shadrach's time,
the native organs of the Khan's body removed and replaced, sometimes
several times over, with transplanted substitutes. Shadrach does not
see much value in preserving Genghis Mao's fourth liver in his
collection, his eighth spleen, his thirteenth kidney, though he
recognizes that these temporary residents of the Khan are more
intimate artifacts of Genghis Mao than, say, his bedroom slippers or
his wristwatch. But he prefers the genuine somatoplasm, and a piece
of authentic aorta is the best he can do just now.</P>
<P>There's the aneurysm, big and ripe, ready to pop.
Another few days and it might have ruptured, <I>poof! </I>and no more
Genghis Mao. The Chairman and Mangu might have shared the same
funeral, come Saturday, if Shadrach hadn't felt odd twitterings in
the circulatory-system sensors and correctly guessed their import. So
I have saved the Khan's life, not for the first time and he is once
more restored to perfect health. Fine. Fine. May he live five hundred
years, and may I be his physician always!</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3><I>16</I></H3>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Alone in his office, ruminating over his medical
treasures, his books and old instruments and now this bit of bottled
aorta, Shadrach feels safe and comfortably entrenched. This Avatar
disturbance will blow over. The Khan, after all, is conservative; he
will cling to his own Mongol body, the well-loved and sturdy
patchwork carcass, as long as he can, whatever the temptations may be
for him to jump into Shadrach's strong, young, and vital frame. So
there will be no precipitous exit for Shadrach, and in the months or
perhaps years ahead he can try to shift the Khan's fantasies entirely
away from Project Avatar and toward Project Talos. Which will mean
aborting the researches of Nikki Crowfoot, but Shadrach can't feel
too guilty about that, all things considered.</P>
<P>He gives the aorta pride of place on his shelves.
Centuries from now it may be sacred, enshrined in a reliquary of
ivory and platinum, and the groveling faithful will chant thanks to
the sainted Shadrach Mordecai for having saved for posterity this
shred of divine meat. Who knows? There is an apocryphal story that
many of Genghis Mao's original organs are preserved in some
labyrinthine secret tunnel, kept in cold storage or perhaps
maintained in vivo, for eventual use in cloning the Khan. Shadrach
doubts this. If Genghis Mao <I>had </I>any serious interest in being
cloned, huge budgetary appropriations would be going to support
tissue-culture research, and, so far as Shadrach knows, not much is
going on in that area. Or, more likely, there would already be a
battalion of genetically perfect duplicates of Genghis Mao lying in
suspension tanks on five or six continents, waiting to be summoned
into life.</P>
<P>Mordecai has often thought of writing a scientific
monograph on his patient, a medical biography of Genghis Mao, a full
record of the myriad transplants and implants, the infinity of
surgical jugglements, that are responsible for the Khan's longevity
and perhaps for his terrifying vitality. There would be nothing in
the literature to compare with it, not even Beaumont on Alexis St.
Martin's digestive tract, not even Lord Moran on Churchill: had ever
there been so single-minded and long-sustained a medical effort,
spanning so many decades, to keep one human being alive and well?
Already the achievement verges on the miraculous, but the real
miracles stilllie ahead, as Genghis Mao, ageless and eternally
renewed, lives on to be a hundred, a hundred ten, a hundred twenty.
There is another, greater temptation&mdash;to write not merely a
medical study but a full-scale account of Genghis Mao's life. No
biography of the Chairman exists, other than vague, sanitized
publicity pamphlets, mere recitals of his political accomplishments
and other exterior events, avoiding all details of his private life.
It is as though the Khan has a superstitious fear of having his soul
captured on paper. And so Shadrach's impulsive fantasy: to nail the
Khan in words, to pin him down with literary juju: It is one means of
gaining control over the world's most powerful man, at least in a
metaphorical way.</P>
<P>The trouble is, no source material is available.
The computer banks of Ulan Bator are gorged with intimate data about
every human being alive&mdash;except Genghis Mao. Press the right
button and platoons of facts march forth&mdash;but none about Genghis
Mao. The facts of his life are unknown and may be unknowable, beyond
the most elementary public milestones, his promulgation of the
philosophy of centripetal depolarization, his founding of the PRC,
his election to the Chairmanship. All the rest has been suppressed,
even obliterated. When was he bom? In what obscure village? What was
his childhood like, what were his boyhood ambitions? What was his
original name, in the old People's Republic days before he proclaimed
himself to be Genghis Mao? What was the early course of his career?
What sort of education did he have? Did he ever travel abroad? Was he
ever married? A father? Yes, that's a good question &mdash;are there,
somewhere in Mongolia, middle-aged men and women who are in fact the
blood children of Genghis Mao, and, if so, do they know who their
father is? No one can answer these questions. No one can answer any
questions about Genghis Mao except with hearsay, apocrypha, and myth.
He has very carefully covered his traces, so carefully that the utter
success of the attempt at total concealment argues a kind of madness.
</P>
<P>But is anyone, even Genghis Mao, really willing to
expunge from the world all traces of his private self? Criminals are
said to return compulsively to the scene of the crime; possibly those
who seek to shroud themselves in mystery tend also to undo their own
mystifications by burying, for history's sake, a full account of all
they have tried to hide. Is there no place where Genghis Mao has
secreted a concealed record of everything he has kept from the
knowledge of his subjects? Say, a diary, an intimate and revealing
diary, a repository for the essence of Genghis Mao's masked soul.
Shadrach imagines himself stumbling across such a document among the
Khan's effects&mdash;a single billion-bit bubble-chip, smaller than a
fingertip, on which is implanted the raw red stuff of Genghis Mao's 
life, his confessions, his unvarnished memoirs, out of which the
faithful doctor Shadrach Mordecai will construct the first and only
true account of the strange and sinister man who came to dominate the
dying civilization of the early twenty-first century.</P>
<P>Of course there is no such diary. Ordinary thieves
and felons may compulsively jeopardize their own safety, but Shadrach
knows Genghis Mao well enough to realize that if he wants to live in
secrecy, he will leave no hidden memoirs around for others to find.
The private Genghis Mao is just as secretive as the public one: open
one empty box and another, even more empty, lies within. No matter.
In his fantasy role as the biographer of Genghis Mao, Shadrach will
fantasize the Khan's memoirs as well, inventing the source material
that Genghis Mao has neglected to provide. He closes his eyes. He
lets his imagination slip free of the leash. Recreates the diary of
the Khan within the crucible of his own throbbing brain.</P>

</P>
<P><I>November 11, 2010.</I></P>
<P><I>My birthday. Genghis Mao is eighty-five today.
No. No. Genghis Mao is</I>&mdash;<I>what</I>&mdash;<I>twenty years
old? About that. It's Dashiyin Choijamste who is eighty-five today.
Dashiyin Choijamste, whom I carry about within me like an internal
twin. Who remembers him, that fat little babe in his proud father's
arms? So long ago, in the village of Dalan-Dzadagad on a snowy night
in 1925. That's down in the province of Southern Gobi,
Dalan-Dzadagad. I haven't</I> <I>been there in fifteen years. My
birthplace, but who knows that? Who knows anything? I know. Dashiyin
Choijamste is eighty-five today. How many others are still alive, of
those born on 11 November 1925? Not many, no. And those who remain
are ancient doddering wrecks. Whereas I am still in my prime, I
Dashiyin Choijamste of Dalan-Dzadagad, son of Yumihaghiyin
Choijamste, director of the camel-breeding station at Bogdo-Goom. I
Genghis Mao. I feel strong today, oh, yes, eighty-five and robust.
Not altogether because of the transplants, either. It's heredity that
does it. The good old Tatar blood. Don't forget, you were almost
seventy when the Virus War broke out, and yet not at all old,
tremendous vigor, all your teeth, jet-black hair, twenty-kilometer
hikes every week; you hadn't had any transplants yet. You were still
Dashiyin Choijamste then. Strange syllables, awkward now on the
tongue, though that was your name for more than six decades. And I
lived right through the Virus War untouched by the rot. People fell
apart all around me. Sickening to behold. I didn't go in for
transplants until later, much later, natural ravages of time,
eventually, but not until after the power had come to me. The power.
I have attained the highest power. And now clever doctors aid my
natural Tatar vigor. I might live another fifty years.</I></P>
<P><I>I might live much longer than that. </I>
</P>
<P><I>Do I remember my childhood? How much snow piles
up in eighty-five years! I think I can see my father's face, lean
like mine, strong eyebrows, strong cheekbones. Yumzaghiyin Choijamste
of the camel-breeding station at Bogdo-Goom, Hero of the Order of
Lenin, later. Wounded at the battle of Khalkhin Gol in 1939,
afterward third secretary of the Agricultural Agency&mdash; see,
Father, I remember, I remember! The father of Genghis Mao killed in
1948 in a plane crash, between Moscow and Ulan Bator, coming home
from a wheat conference. Those miserable Soviet jets, forever falling
from the sky. Or was it a jet? So long ago: The jets were already in
service then, weren't they, the Ilyushins, the Tupolevs? I could look
it up. You are dead sixty-two years, Yumzhaghiyin Choijamste. Babies
born the night your plane fell are old people now. And I am still
here, Father. I am Genghis Mao. I remember you at the camel station.
I am standing in new snow and my father tugs on a camel's halter. The
camel looms above me like a mountain, long homely face, rubbery lips,
sweet dull eyes with undertones of subtle contempt. The camel leans
toward me and its enormous tongue slurps across my cheeks, my lips. A
kiss! Its sour breath. My father's laughter. He scoops me in his
arms, gives me a crushing hug. How huge he is! Bigger than the camel,
to me. I am three, four years old.</I></P>
<P><I>And my mother? My mother? I never knew her.
Trampled by yaks in a wild snowstorm when I was an infant. I have
forgotten your name, Mother. I could look it up, But where...
where...?</I></P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Shadrach pauses, reflects, reconsiders. Is it
plausible? Does it have internal consistency? The tone is right, but
what about the &quot;facts&quot;? He will test them. Shall he alter
some significant details? Will that make any difference? Let's see&mdash;</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><I>October 17, 2012.</I></P>
<P><I>My birthday. Genghis Mao is ninety-two today,
though officially I am said to be a mere eighty-seven. On the other
hand, some of them believe I'm well over one hundred. Meaning that I
was born in 1905 or so. Can they believe that? Isn't 1920 bad enough?
Wilson, Clemenceau, Henry Ford, General Pershing, Lloyd George,
Lenin, Trotsky, Sukhe Bator... men of my time. And I am still here,
anno domini 2012, I, the former Namsan Gombojab, born in Sain-Shanda,
youngest son of the yak-herder Khorloghiyin Gombojab, who</I>&mdash;</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>No. Changing the details is trivial. Let his
original name be Choijamste, Gombojab, Ochirbal, whatever; let him
have been born in 1925, 1920, 1915, even 1910; let him have spent his
career in the Ministry of Defense, the Agency for Agrarian
Redistribution, the Commissariat of Telecommunications; slather on
any kind of factual decoration you like; none of it will make any
difference. The essential patterns of the soul of Genghis Mao run
deep and heavy, and they, his perceptions, his world view, are your
subject, Shadrach. Not the trivia of time and place.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><I>May 14, 2012.</I></P>
<P><I>Just two hours ago the liver transplant was
finished, and here lies Genghis Mao, old and leathery, not dead yet,
no, not by much; he is alert, full of energy, wide awake. I am proud
of him. The unquenchable vitality of him. The insufferable resilience
of him. I hail you, Genghis Mao! Ha! I feel pain in my abdomen, but
it's nothing to moan about. Pain is the signal that we live, we feel,
we respond to stimuli. The heaviness that came over me when the old
liver began to fail is already going. I feel my system flushing
itself clean. It is as if I float two meters above my own bed.
Hovering over all the beautiful machinery that pumps healing fluids
into my earthly husk. How beautiful is the pain. That throb, low and
to one side... boom, boom, boom, a bell tolling within old Genghis
Mao, urging him on to long life. Ten thousand years to the Emperor!
My clever doctors triumph again. Warhaftig, Mordecai.</I></P>
<P><I>My doctors. Warhaftig is a mere machine. He
bores me, but he is perfect. I love to see his hands disappear into
the hole in my belly. And come forth grasping some limp red lump full
of disease, throw it aside, stitch a new organ into its place.
Warhaftig never fails. But he is ugly, with that flat nose, those
downturned lips. Sick dead white skin. A genius, but ugly and boring,
a mere machine. Was Warhaftig ever young? Crouching behind a bush to
spy on the naked women bathing in a stream? Not him. Oh, no, not him.
Laughing, tumbling on the grass? Warhaftig? Never!</I></P>
<P><I>Shadrach is more interesting. Graceful, witty,
a fine strong body, a clear cool mind. He is pleasing to look at. His
black skin. I never saw a black until I was forty and a delegation
from Guinea visited my department. Their shiny faces, almost purple,
their dense knotty hair, their tribal robes. Dazzling white eyes,
pink palms like gorillas, deep voices, strange, strange. They spoke
French. Shadrach is not like those Africans except that he has the
same sort of keen, serious intelligence. He is brown, not black, very
tall, very American, nothing of the jungle about him. Sometimes he
lectures me as if I am a child, a naughty babe. Always worrying about
my health. Conscientious, he is, earnest, dedicated, boyish. He is
too sane for us here. He lacks</I>&mdash; <I>what? Darkness, can I
say that of him? Yes. Interior darkness is what he lacks: there are
no demons in him. Or do I underestimate him? There must be demons in
everyone, even the robot Warhaftig, even the calm and good-humored
Shadrach Mordecai. He is very young. I like that. He is at least
fifty years younger than I am, and yet we are contemporaries, we are
both men of the present moment, both of us unknown until relatively
recently, though I waited so long to become who I am and he became
himself so young. He smiles well. There is nothing cynical about him
yet. He has lived through the Virus War and all the ugly things that
followed and yet he is tranquil, he has faith in the future, he
thinks only of healing people. He would heal those who enslaved his
ancestors, even. Whereas I would avenge myself against the oppressors
a thousand times over; but then, I am of Tatar stock, and we are
fierce, we are Gobi wolves, while he is the child of placid jungle
farmers. Every morning he goes into Surveillance Vector One and
stares at the rotting people all over the world. Thinks I don't know.
I watch him watching. His lean mobile face, his sad intelligent eyes.
He feels such sorrow for the rotting ones. A man of compassion.
Childlike. Not saintly, but he has the stuff of martyrs in him.</I></P>

<P><I>The Committee in plenary session. Horthy,
Labile, Ionigylakis, Eyuboglu, Lapostolle, Farinosa, Parlator,
Blount. All the finest bureaucrats. Drone, drone, drone, and I
listened, not listening, to it all. They are machines. The Committee
itself is a machine which I have constructed, a delicate and useless
mechanism, like a clock without hands. When I die it will fall apart,
if I die when I die. I allowed Mangu to preside. Bit by bit I ease
him into the pretense of responsibility, the shadow of authority. He
is fascinated by that mob of dreary bureaucrats, those </I>apparatchiks,
<I>as a boy is fascinated by the buzzing of dung-flies, and never
mind the dung. Was this what I had in mind when I seized the reins of
the world, that I would father upon it a Permanent Revolutionary
Committee of dung-flies? Revolutionaries! Lapostolle sleeps; Farinosa
longs for Karakorum and sits twitching his long nose; Ionigylakis's
belly rumbles. I should have named more Mongols to the Committee;
these white foreigners have no fire. But I need my Mongols elsewhere.
I should not let them turn into drones. Snore, snore, snore! It snows
again today. I could slip from the Committee room, out of the
building, secretly into the snow, lie in it, roll in it, throw
handfuls in the air. Summon a horse and ride all night, no saddle,
hooves silent on the whiteness, man and beast crossing the steppe
without a pause, crust of bread for me, a goatskin full o fairag to
gulp along the way &mdash;aye, I'm still a boy, I who am so ancient,
and they are old men! But of course Shadrach would forbid it. I rule
the world, he rules me. What if I insisted? Must I endure these
droning flies when there is fresh snow on the Gobi? </I>
</P>
<P><I>You can replace a crumbled kidney, I will tell
him; surely you can repair an old man's frostbit nose. Yes. Yes. I
will go. I will. I must escape from this boredom.</I></P>
<P><I>Is this what I had in mind when I seized the
reins ?</I></P>
<P><I>What did I have in mind?Did I have anything in
mind, except that everything was falling apart, and It was my task to
hold it together? I think that was it. The world had descended into
chaos. How I abhor disorder! Such turmoil, such confusion: the dying
people, the dead nations, hordes of wild men sweeping across the
land, nothing simple, all simplicity gone from the world. I love
simplicity, a neatly organized structure, harmonious and satisfying,
one nation, one government, one code of laws, everything one, onward
to the horizon, I was seventy-three years old, and strong. The world
was millions of years old, and weak. I could not bear the chaos. I
think all those who have ruled the world were basically haters of
chaos rather than mere lovers of power. Napoleon, Attila, Alexander,
great Genghis, even poor crazy Hitler, all of them wanted things to
be neat, to be simple, they had a vision of order, that is, and saw
no other way to attain that order except to impose it themselves upon
the world. As did I. Of course, most of them eventually spawned more
chaos than they were removing, and they had to be removed themselves.
Hitler, for example. I have not made that mistake. To the end, I do
battle against entropy, I offer myself , Genghis II Mao IV. as the
symbol of oneness, the focus of worldwide energy, the crystal of
simplicity. But oh, Father Genghis, these plenary sessions, this
droning, these dung-flies. Father Genghis, did you have a Horthy to
harangue you ? Did you sit idle, dreaming of a swift horse and an icy
wind, listening to a Partator and a Blount? Oh! Oh! Was it for this
that I took upon myself the chaos of the crumbling rotting world?</I></P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Shadrach rises. He can sit here in reverie no
longer; he has responsibilities, obligations, reports to file,
projects to oversee.</P>
<P>To begin with, he must update the Genghis Mao
dossier with a concise account of today's aorta transplant, which
means collating a vast sheaf of printouts and selecting from that
mass of raw and fragmentary data the significant outlines of a useful
medical profile. Very well. He taps keys, summoning the outtakes of
this morning's operation. But as he works, he finds his mind invaded
at times by the spurious voice of Genghis Mao, dictating stray shreds
of imaginary memoir:</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><I>May 27, 1998.</I></P>
<P><I>The People's Republic is leaderless this
morning and I think the government will collapse before noon.
Shirendyb, the fifth prime minister in the past six weeks, succumbed
to the organ-rot late last night. No one is left in the politburo;
the presidium has been decimated; the streets of Ulan Bator are
choked with refugees, a slow steady stream of oxcarts and dilapidated
trucks heading&mdash; where? It is the same everywhere. The old
society is dying. Only ten years ago I thought fundamental change was
impossible; then came the volcano, the terror, the uprising, the
Virus War, the organ-rot, and three billion human beings are dead and
institutions are crumbling like shoddy buildings struck by
earthquakes. I will not lea ve Ulan Bator. I think my time is at last
at hand. But the government I will proclaim will not be called a
people's republic.</I></P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><I>November 16, 2008.</I></P>
<P><I>To celebrate the tenth year of my reign I
journeyed to Karakorum and dedicated the new pleasure complex. They
invited me to experience the amusements they call &quot;dream-death&quot;
and &quot;transtemporalism. &quot; I chose dream-death. The
irresistible fascination of the morbid. Especially the illusion of
the morbid. It takes place in a tent full of pseudo-Egyptian motifs.
The ugly old monster-gods hovering like gargoyles over the place; you
can practically smell the reek of Nile mud, hear the buzzing of the
flies. Attendants with masks. Bright lights. Much fuss made over me.
Naturally I was the only one having the experience at that time. I
allowed myself to be hypnotized behind a phalanx of picked security
guards. A sensation as of dying, very convincing, I think. (What does
any of us know about it?) And then a dream. But in my dream the world
was exactly as it is when I am awake. They promised me gaudy
illusions and surreal fantasies. None. Have they deceived me? Are
they afraid to let Genghis Mao taste the true experience?</I></P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><I>June 4, 2010.</I></P>
<P><I>Today the new physician began his duties.
Shadrach Mordecai, a strange name. American, bright, earnest. He is
terrified of me but that may pass. He holds himself so stiffly when
he is with me! His training is in gerontology and he has been on the
staff of Project Phoenix for several years. I told him this morning:
&quot;We make a deal, you and I. You keep me healthy, I keep you
healthy, all right?&quot; He smiled but behind that he was plainly
upset. Too heavy-handed of me, I suppose.</I></P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Somehow Shadrach finishes dictating the profile
and moves along to the next task, which is to look over a project
report from Irayne Sarafrazi. Nothing much new there; her project
continues to wrestle with the brain-cell-deterioration problem and,
as Shadrach has foreseen, is getting nowhere. All the same, he must
read the report through and find some encouraging comment to make.
Still the insidious voice resonates in his head, distracting him with
bursts of fantasy. Doggedly he works on, trying to ignore the mental
static.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><I>May 15, 2012.</I></P>
<P><I>The most terrible news. Assassins have murdered
Mangu. Comes now Horthy, bleating hysterically about falling bodies.
How could this have happened? Into Mangu's bedchamber, silently,
seize him, to the window, out! Oh, my fury. Oh, my bitter grief. What
will I do now? My plans for Mangu thwarted. Shadrach tells me Project
Phoenix is stymied, probably forever, on biological problems. Project
Talos moves slowly, and Talos I have never really liked. Which leaves
Avatar, and Avatar without Mangu is</I>&mdash;</P>
<P><I>Ah. I will use Shadrach. A fine body&mdash;
I'll be happy in it. And black. A novelty. I should experience all
the varieties of humanity. Perhaps when Shadrach's body is old I
should move on into a white one</I>&mdash;<I>even a woman,
perhaps</I>&mdash;<I>perhaps a giant someday, or a dwarf&mdash;all
possibilities</I>&mdash;</P>
<P><I>Shadrach has been a good doctor and a pleasant
companion. But there are other doctors, and companionship becomes
ever less important to me. Shall I feel guilty about snuffing him
out? For a while, perhaps a day, two days. But I must put myself
beyond such feelings.</I></P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><I>May 16, 2012.</I></P>
<P><I>More thoughts on the choice of Shadrach to
replace Mangu. Obviously some residual guilt lurking in me. But why?
I propose not to murder him but to ennoble him by making his body the
vehicle for immense power. Of course he might object that what I
propose for him is, if not murder outright, then at best a form of
slavery, and his kind has endured slavery enough. But no: Shadrach is
not his ancestors, and all old debts have been canceled by the Virus
War, which destroyed slaves and masters indiscriminately, struck down
generals as well as babes, and left those who survived in the
condition of pure survivors, pastless, liberated into a new
dispensation in which history is born fresh and virgin each day. What
do the sins of the slavemasters mean to anyone today? The society,
the network of relationships, that evolved under the stimulus of
slavery and its consequences, even of emancipation and its
consequences, is wholly gone. And I am Genghis Mao and I require his
body. I need not vex myself with the guilt of others. I am not
German; I can send Jews to the oven if the need arises, without
making apologies for past sins. I am not white; therefore I am free
to enslave a black. The past is dead. History is blank pages now.
Besides, if historical imperatives do still exist, I am a Mongol: my
forefathers enslaved half the world. Can I do less? I will have his
body.</I></P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><I>May 27, 2012.</I></P>
<P><I>I monitor this week's conversation tapes and
find that Katya Lindman has told Shadrach the truth, that he is the
next Avatar donor. Katya talks too much. It wasn't</I> <I>my
intention to have him find that out, but let it go. I will watch him
closely, now that he possesses the knowledge. The sufferings of
humanity instruct me in the arts of government. Or, to put it more
harshly, I enjoy watching them squirm. Is that not ugly? But I have
earned the right to indulge in some ugly pastimes, I who have borne
the burdens of power for fourteen years. I haven't been Hitler, have
I? I haven't been Caligula. Yet power does entitle one to certain
amusements. By way of compensation for the murderous burden, the
awful responsibility. The odd thing is that Shadrach isn't</I>
<I>squirming, yet. He is oddly calm. Doesn't yet believe that what
Katya told him is true, I guess. Doesn't accept it in the viscera. He
will. Wait. Just wait. It'll hit him, sooner or later.</I></P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Suddenly this game is not in the least amusing to
Shadrach. There is no fun, any longer, in these subtle exercises in
ironic parallax, these experiments in psychological perspective. The
distance between himself and what he has been inventing has narrowed
abruptly, and indeed it is all suddenly very painful, it cuts much
too close to the nerve, it hurts, it hurts with astonishing
intensity. He has managed in the last ten minutes to puncture his own
affectless equanimity, and he is not merely squirming now, he is
bleeding. Pain, fear, and anger assail him. He feels that everyone
has conspired to sell him down the river. He&mdash; witty, urbane,
handsome, humane, dedicated Shadrach Mordecai&mdash;is just another
expendable nigger, it turns out. If what Katya has told him is true.
If. If. Shadrach is in anguish. This, now, here is the furnace, and
he is in it for sure. The heavy shadow of Genghis Mao weighs upon
him. One day they will come for him, they will put the electrodes to
him, they will wipe out his unique and irreplaceable soul, and
shortly thereafter they will pump that crafty old Mongol into his
skull. Is that how it really will be? Yes, Katya says. And can he
believe that? Should he believe that? He trembles. Terror whips
through him like a cold gale. He craves peace; he could use a jolt of
Genghis Mao's tranquilizer now, a hefty jolt of 9-pordenone or maybe
something stronger. But Shadrach dislikes drugging himself in crisis.
He needs his sharpest wits now.</P>
<P>What shall he do?</P>
<P>The first step is one he knows he should have
taken yesterday. He will go to Nikki Crowfoot again. And ask her some
questions.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3><I>17</I></H3>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>She is pale qnd peaked-looking, still in the grip
of yesterday's illness, but on the mend, definitely on the mend. She
seems to know why he has come, and it takes only half a dozen harsh
words from him to get from her the answer he did not really want to
hear. Yes, it is true. Yes. Yes. Shadrach listens for a while to her
stammering confession, full of circumlocutions and evasions, and then
he says, quietly, reproachfully, &quot;You couldhave told me before
this.&quot; He is staring straight at her, and now, finally, she
returns his stare: now that it is all out in the open between them,
now that she has admitted the monstrous truth, she is at last able to
meet his eyes again. &quot;You could have told me,&quot; he says.
&quot;Why didn't you tell me, Nikki?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I couldn't. It wasn't possible.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Wasn't possible? Wasn't possible? Sure it
was possible. All you had to do was open your mouth and let words
come out. 'Shadrach, I think I ought to warn you that you&mdash;' &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Stop,&quot; she says. &quot;It didn't seem
that easy to me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;When was it decided?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The day they sent Buckmaster to the organ
farm.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Did you have any part in selecting me?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Do you think I could have had any part in
it, Shadrach?&quot;</P>
<P>He says, &quot;One thing I learned a long time ago
is that guilty people have a way of answering a troublesome question
with another question.&quot;</P>
<P>But she does not seem wounded by his thrust, and
instantly he regrets having made it. She is a strong woman, quite
calm now that she has been unmasked by him, and in an altogether
steady voice she says, &ldquo;Genghis Mao chose you all by himself. I
wasn't consulted.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Very well.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You might as well believe that.&quot;</P>
<P>Shadrach nods. &quot;I believe it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And so?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;When you learned I was the one, did you make
any attempt to change his mind?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Has anyone ever changed Genghis Mao's mind
about anything?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You notice how you parry my question with a
question of your own?&quot;</P>
<P>This time the jab hurts. She loses some of her
newly regained poise. Her eyes slip from his, and she says hollowly,
&quot;All right. All right. I didn't try to argue with him, no.&quot;</P>
<P>Shadrach is silent a moment. Then he says, &quot;I
thought I knew you pretty well, Nikki, but I was wrong.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What does that mean?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I believed you were the sort of person who
sees human beings as ends, not means. I didn't think you'd let a&mdash;ah&mdash;a
close friend&mdash;be nominated for the junkheap, and not lift a
finger to save him, and not even say a word to him about it, no hint
of what's been decreed for him. And start to avoid him, even. As if
you had written him off as an unperson the moment he was chosen. As
if you were afraid that his bad luck might be contagious.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why are you lecturing me, Shadrach?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Because I hurt,&quot; he says. &quot;Because
someone I loved sold me out. Because I can't bring myself to hurt you
back in any way that's real.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What would you have wanted me to do?&quot;
Nikki asks. 
</P>
<P>&quot;The right thing.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Which was?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You could have stood up to Genghis Mao. You
could have told him you wouldn't participate in your lover's
slaughter. You could have let him know that there was a relationship
between us, that you weren't capable of&mdash;oh, Christ, Nikki, I
shouldn't have to be explaining all this to you!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I'm sure Genghis Mao was quite aware of the
relationship between us.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And picked me deliberately, by way of
testing your loyalty? To find out how you would react if you were
made to choose between your lover and your laboratory? One of his
little psychological games?&quot;</P>
<P>She shrugs. &quot;That's entirely conceivable.&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;Maybe you made the wrong choice, then. Maybe
he was trying to measure your fundamental humanity rather than your
loyalty to Genghis Mao. And now that he sees how coldblooded,
soulless, unfeeling you are, he may decide that he can't take the
chance of having a person like you in charge of&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Stop it, Shadrach.&quot; She is giving
ground under his steady assault, his quiet, measured, remorseless
voice; her lips are trembling, she is visibly fighting back tears.
&quot;Please,&quot; she says. &quot;Stop. Stop. You're getting what
you want.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You think I'm being unkind? You think I've
got no call being angry with you?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There was nothing I could have done.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Nothing?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Nothing.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What about threatening to resign?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;He'd have let me resign, then. I'm not
indispensable. Redundancy is&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And your successor would have continued with
the project, using me as the donor.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I imagine so.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Still, even if it changed nothing at all,
wouldn't you have felt cleaner putting up some kind of resistance?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Perhaps,&quot; she says. &quot;But it would
have changed nothing at all.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You could have warned me, at least. I might
have fled from Ulan Bator. We might have fled together, if your
resignation got you in trouble with Genghis Mao. Wasn't worth
destroying your career over me, though, was it?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Flee? Where to? He'd be watching us. On
Surveillance Vector One, or some other spy gadget. In a day or two
he'd decide we had had a long enough holiday, and the Citpols would
pick us up and bring us back.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Maybe.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Not maybe. And I'd end up in the organ farm.
And you'd still become the Avatar donor.&quot;</P>
<P>Shadrach considers that scenario. &quot;You're
telling me that it wouldn't have mattered whether you had warned me
or not?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Not to you,&quot; Nikki replies. &quot;It
would have mattered to me. One way I lose my job and maybe my skin.
The other way I get to survive a little longer.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I still wish you had been the one to tell
me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Instead of Katya?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;When did I say Katya was the one?&quot;</P>
<P>Nikki smiles. &quot;You didn't need to, love.&quot;</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><I>August 19, 2009</I></P>
<P><I>A mild summer day in Ulan Bator. Across half
the world it is summer now. The time of lovers. Surveillance Vector
One shows me the lovers going arm in arm through the streets of
Paris, London, San Francisco, Tokyo. The fond gazes, the little
kisses, the nudges of hip against hip. Even the ones with organ-rot
shuffling along together, slowly dying but still doing the dance of
love. Fools! I think I remember how that dance goes, though it's
forty or fifty years behind me. Yes, yes, the first meeting, the
preliminary tensions and assessments, theprobing andparrying, the
spark of contact, the dissolving of barriers, the first embrace, the
tender words, the pledges, the sense of conspiracy, two against the
world, the assumption that all this will last forever, the discovery
that it will not, the falling apart, the falling out, the parting,
the healing, the forgetting</I>&mdash;<I>oh, yes, the man who is
Genghis Mao once danced that dance, long before he was Genghis Mao,
he once played that game. Long ago. What purpose does it serve? An
anesthetic for the aching ego. A lubricant for the biological
necessities. A diversion, a distraction, a foolishness. When I saw it
for what it was I renounced it, and no regrets. Look at them
strolling together. &ldquo;Eternal love.'' As if anything's eternal,
but love? </I>Love? <I>It's an unstable state, thermodynamic
nonsense, two energy sources, two suns, trying to establish orbits
around one another, each one striving to give light and heat to the
other. How pretty it sounds, how implausible. Naturally the system
breaks down under gravitational stress sooner or later, and one pulls
the other to pieces, or they spiral into collision, or they go
tumbling away from one another. A waste of energy, a futile spilling
of the life-force. Love? Abolish it! If only I could.</I></P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><I>January 4, 1989</I></P>
<P><I>The text of my doctrine is complete, and when
the appropriate moment comes I will reveal it to the world. Today, as
I finished the last passages, a name for it came to me: </I>centripetal
depolarization. <I>Defined as the forging of a consensus of
irreconcilables through the illusion of the attainment of everyone's
mutually exclusive goals. And it will sweep the world as irresistibly
as once did the hordes of old Father Genghis.</I></P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Shadrach takes momentary refuge in carpentry.
Until now that fashionable cult has been mere amusement for him, a
source of relaxation and release rather than the quasi-mystical focus
that it is for many of its adherents, but now, frayed and desperate,
no longer the calm and detached Shadrach of yore, he surrenders to
its full intensity. The world has tightened around him. Ostensibly,
all is as it has been, and is not going to change; his routines will
continue, his doctoring and his calisthenics and his collecting and
his trips to Karakorum; but in these past two days, aware now of the
dread subtraction of self that Genghis Mao has covertly ordained for
him, Shadrach finds the familiar and comfortable rhythms of life no
longer enough to keep him together. Fear and pain have begun to seep
into his soul, and the only antidote he knows for that is submission
to some force greater than himself, greater even than Genghis Mao,
some all-encompassing power. If he can, he will make carpentry the
vehicle of that submission. With hammer and nails, then, with chisel
and adze, with plane and saw and awl, he seeks, if not salvation,
then at least temporary freedom from anguish.</P>
<P>Usually Shadrach attends the large and majestic
carpentry chapel in Karakorum. But there is always a carnival
atmosphere in Karakorum, and that tends to trivialize whatever he
does there, be it carpentry or dream-death or transtemporalism or
mere fornication. Now, in genuine spiritual need, he wants not the
fanciest chapel but the one most readily accessible, the one that
will enable him most quickly to find surcease from pain, and he goes
to a place here in Ulan Bator, down by the Tuula River, in one of
those streets of formidable blocky white-stucco buildings constructed
in the latter days of the Mongolian Peoples Republic.</P>
<P>It is a starkly functional no-nonsense sort of
chapel, lacking in any religious or pseudoreligious iconography. Big
bare rooms, sputtering fluorescent lights, the smell of sawdust and
lemon oil&mdash;it could be an ordinary carpenters' shop, but for the
silence and the peculiar concentration with which the men and women
at the benches are going about their tasks. Shadrach pays a fee at
the entrance&mdash;strictly a service charge, covering the cost of
tool rental, lumber, and maintenance, never a fee for worship
itself&mdash;and is shown to a locker where he exchanges his street
clothes for clean coveralls. Then he selects a vacant bench. Shining
well-oiled tools have been arranged along and around it with an eye
for symmetry and neatness that is positively Japanese: chisels of
many sizes in a precisely ordered row, an assortment of hammers and
mallets, a cluster of gauges, augers, pincers, compasses, bevels,
files, try squares, and rules. The equipment is deliberately varied
and copious, to impress upon the worshipper the hieratic nature of
the craft, the ancient lineage of its practice, the complexity of its
scope.</P>
<P>No one speaks to him. No one looks at him. No one
will; those who enter here must remain alone with their tools and
their wood. A strange solemnity steals over him as he makes ready to
enter the customary initial stale of meditation. In the past, having
come to the chapel for nothing more than a relaxing couple of hours
of cutting and joining, seeing the whole experience as an amusement
on the same level as a round of golf or a game of billiards, he has
approached this stage of the ceremony in a casual and amiable way,
accepting it as part of the tradition, something that one does merely
to get into the spirit of the thing, the equivalent of a golfer's
ritualized practice swings or a billiards player's careful chalking
of the cue; but this time, as he presses both hands flat against the
workbench and bows his head, he feels neither flippant nor stagily
ostentatious; he is aware of a numinous presence all about him, and
he grows somber and reflective as it enters his soul.</P>
<P>In the meditation one first must consider the
tools, their form and divine essence. One must visualize them and
name them: this is a tenon saw, this a dovetail saw, this a gimlet,
this a brad-awl. One then must dwell on their purpose, which requires
one to imagine each tool in action, and this in turn calls for
contemplation of certain basic techniques of carpentry and joinery:
the making of mortises and tenons, the construction of joists and
frames, the fitting of veneers, the setting of braces and struts and
wedging. This phase of the meditation is the most prolonged and the
most intense. Shadrach has heard that some adherents to the cult
devote the entire energy of their worship to it, and never actually
take tools and wood into their hands, but carry out a completely
satisfying communion in their minds alone. Until today he has never
really understood how this could be accomplished, but now, scribing
and mitring and butting as he sits with closed eyes, menially fitting
tenon into mortise and tongue into groove, he sees that actual manual
labor can be extraneous to this experience if one is able fully to
enter into the meditative phase.</P>
<P>He perceives this, but he moves on anyway into the
terminal stage of the meditation, which is the entry into the wood,
the mother-stuff. This too is a highly structured exercise, which one
must begin by imagining trees, not merely any trees but specific
timber trees of one's own choice, ordinarily pine or spruce or fir
for Shadrach, occasionally more exotic woods, according to his whim,
ebony, palisander, mahogany, teak. One must <I>see </I>the tree; one
must imagine it felled; one must carry it onward to be milled and
seasoned; one must at last behold the finished board, and contemplate
its grain, its texture, its moisture content, its vulnerability to
shrinkage and warpage, all its characteristics and special beauties.
And then, only then, when one can taste the wood on one's tongue,
when one feels the tool hot and eager in one's hand, then does one
rise and go to the bin and select one's lumber and begin at last to
work.</P>
<P>Shadrach knows, by the time he has reached this
stage, exactly what the form of his worship will be today. He will do
no fancy joinery this day, but simple heavy carpentry, simple but
pure, a job that strikes to the essence of form: he will construct
the centering for a brick arch. It has sprung entire into his mind,
the ribs and ties, the braces and struts, the laggings, the wedges;
he has calculated the curvature, the span, the height of the crown,
the springing line, all in one rush of inner vision, and now he need
only cut and fit and hammer, and when he is done he will disassemble
everything, carry out the ceremonial burning of the sawdust, and
depart, drained and eased of tension.</P>
<P>He works quickly. A kind of wild feverish energy
has come over him. He hastens from bin to bench, from bin to bench;
his mouth bristles with nails of half a dozen lengths; he does not
pause for an instant. Yet there is nothing rushed about his labor. To
rush would be folly; the point here is to attain calmness of spirit.
The work should be accomplished swiftly but without haste. Serenely
Shadrach builds. The work contains its own purpose and has none
beyond the immediate spiritual fulfillment, for one never <I>uses
</I>anything one constructs in the carpentry chapel, one never takes
anything away that one has put together, any more than one would
bring in one's own tools. This is not a substitute for the home
workshop, after all. The idea here is solely to exercise skill in
joining, and thus to experience the fundamental connectivity of the
universe; what one actually makes is incidental, a means to a higher
end, and must not be allowed to become a goal in itself. Shadrach has
never fully understood that part of it before today, either. He has
enjoyed the physicality of the work, the hammering and the sweat, and
he has enjoyed the aesthetic reward, the pleasure of watching
something sturdy and attractive take shape under his hands, and he
has always felt mildly distressed at the necessary disassembling that
follows; because he has never seen the carpentry cult as anything
more profound than tennis or golf or bicycle riding, he has never
attained those farther reaches of the spirit which he has heard are
available to the communicants here. Now he does attain those reaches,
at least their nearer fringes, and, penetrating unexpected realms, he
finds that <I>his </I>fears and resentments fall away, and he is
purified. So it must have been for the Creator, shaping worlds on
quiet afternoons, experiencing a total sense of identification with
the task, a sense of utter selflessness, of being no more than a
conduit for the great shaping force that flows through the universe.
No doubt one can just as readily attain ihe same tranquil place
through tennis or golf or bicycle riding, Shadrach realizes. The
means is unimportant; only the state of consciousness toward which
one journeys matters. He sees his arch acquiring form; it is not <I>his
</I>arch but <I>the </I>arch, the prototype of all arches, the ideal
arch, the arch on which the vault of the heavens rests, and he and
the arch have become one, and he, Shadrach Mordecai of Utan Bator,
bears all the weight of the cosmos and feels no burden. Does an arch
complain of the load? The arch, if the arch is a proper arch, merely
transmits the weight to the earth, and the earth does not complain
either, but imparts the thrust of its burden to the stars, which
accept it unprotestingly, for there is no burden, there is no weight,
there is simply the ebb and flow of substance between the joined
members of the one great entity that is the matrix of everything; and
when one has perceived that, can it be such a serious matter that
one's body, which at the moment houses a pattern of responses that
calls itself &quot;Shadrach Mordecai,&quot; may soon house instead
something calling itself &quot;Genghis Mao&quot;? Such
transformations are meaningless. Change does nor occur; there are
only transfers, not transformations: the only reality is the reality
of eternal flux. He is purged of all discord and all dismay.</P>
<P>The arch is done. Shadrach briefly admires its
perfection of form; then, calmly, he knocks it apart and carries the
pieces to the salvage bin.</P>
<P>Does the arch no longer exist, simply because its
components have been dismembered? No. The arch exists, shining as
brightly in his mind as when he first conceived it. The arch will
always exist. The arch is indestructible. Shadrach restores his tools
to their original immaculate order, and gathers his sawdust, and
makes the ceremonial pyre of it in the urn in the aisle. When his
bench is as clean as he first found it, he kneels, bows his head, and
remains that way a minute or two, altogether untroubled, mind blank,
a <I>tabula rasa, </I>healed and made whole. Then he goes out.</P>
<P>Images of Mangu are everywhere in the streets, the
handsome Mongol face looking down from the facade of every building
and staring out from great banners strung from lampposts high above
the roadways. At the intersection of three grand boulevards workmen
are diligently erecting the armature for what is undoubtedly going to
be a vast statue of the dead viceroy. The process of canonization is
well advanced; day by day, departed Mangu is thrust more visibly into
the consciousness of the citizens of the world capital, and doubtless
everywhere else as well. Mangu dead has taken on a power and a
presence never possessed by Mangu alive: he has indeed become a
fallen demigod, he is Baldur, Adonis, Osiris, the slaughtered promise
of spring, and he is due to rise again.</P>
<P>Shadrach, cool and bouncy, wanders toward the
river, whistling some lush romantic melody&mdash;a tune out of
Rachmaninoff, he suspects. He is being followed, he realizes, by a
man who emerged from the carpentry chapel a moment after he did. This
does not worry him. For the moment, nothing worries him. He is
charmed by everything: the steppe, the hills, the faintly chilly
spring air, the idea of being followed. He is charmed even by the
silly ubiquity of Mangu, whose bland symmetrical features have been
plastered to everything, and sprout from mailboxes, from trashbins,
from the low smooth white wall of the promenade that runs along the
river; there are Mangu pennants and streamers hanging all around, and
everything is done to a background of the Mongol mourning color,
which is yellow and lends an oddly bright and festive tone to the
display, as though there is shortly to be a parade in Mangu's honor,
followed by the viceroy's glorious second coming. Shadrach smiles. He
leans his long body over the promenade wall to admire the lovely
turbulent flow of the river, quickened by its spring freshets and
humming along with rare energy, swirling and dancing. He imagines
filaments and tendrils of tributary streams spreading outward from
the channel below him, lacing this arid land together, carrying water
joyously from the mountains, sweeping it to the river and thence to
the sea, a vast arterial system serving the living, throbbing entity
that is the earth, and the image pleases the doctor in him. If he
listens carefully, he tells himself, he can hear the breathing of the
planet, and even the rhythms of its heart, <I>tub-dub, tub-dub. </I>The
man who has been following him appears now on the promenade and takes
up a position just to Shadrach's left. Side by side they watch the
river in silence. After a moment Shadrach risks a furtive glance and
discovers that the man is Frank Ficifolia, the communications expert,
the designer of Surveillance Vector One. Ficifolia is a short,
rotund, capable man, perhaps fifty years old, good-natured and
talkative, and his uncharacteristic silence now is significant. Upon
entering the carpentry chapel Shadrach had had a glimpse of someone
he thought might be Ficifolia, but the etiquette of the cult had kept
him from taking a second look; his guess is now confirmed. But a
different etiquette controls Shadrach here. In the bugged and
spy-eyed world of Genghis Mao, one is frequently approached by people
who wish to talk without outwardly seeming to be holding a
conversation. Many times Shadrach has carried on long interchanges
with someone who is staring in another direction, even with someone
whose back is to him. He continues, therefore, to study the rushing
flow of the river, offering Ficifolia no greeting, and waiting.
Eventually Ficifolia says, apropos of nothing and without looking at
Shadrach, &quot;I don't understand why you're still hanging around
here.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Pardon me?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;In Ulan Bator. Waiting for the ax to fall.
If I were you I'd go into hiding, Shadrach.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;So you know about&mdash;&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I know, yes. Several people know. What are
you going to do?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'm not sure. Stay put for  a while, I
guess, and think things over. There's a lot I have to evaluate.&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;Evaluate? <I>Evaluate? </I>Of course you'd
say something like that!&quot; Ficifolia, though plainly trying to be
unobtrusive, cannot control his emotions; he raises his voice; he
gesticulates passionately. &quot;You know, man, you never belonged in
this town. You aren't crazy enough to qualify. You're so calm, so
reasonable, you always want to think things out, you want to stop and
evaluate when they've got the knife to your throat&mdash;how did you
ever land here, anyway? This is a place for madmen. I mean that
seriously, Shadrach. The lunatics are running the asylum, and the
head lunatic is the craziest one of all, and you just don't fit in.
Can you think of anything crazier than a world full of rotting people
governed by a few thousand Antidote-filled bureaucrats and ruled by a
ninety-year-old Mongol warlord who's planning to live forever? This
is sanity? This is the logical outcome of five hundred years of
Western imperialism? And the spy-eyes everywhere? The surveillance
vectors taping my very words right now and feeding them to God knows
what kind of machine where they may not be digested and acted upon
for three thousand years? The robot policemen? The organ farms?
Anyone who begins to take this world at face value has to be a
madman, and that's what we are, all of us, top to bottom, Avogadro,
Horthy, Lindman, Labile, me, the whole crew. Except you. So solemn,
so contained, so accepting. Doing your job, doing your job, you and
Warhaftig, stitching the new liver into the Khan, never cracking a
smile, never saying to each other. This is a  crazy way of making a
living, never even perceiving the craziness because you're so
fundamentally sane&mdash;not Warhaftig, he's either a robot or a
lunatic, but you, Shadrach, deadpan, full of weird microelectronic
gear and even that doesn't upset you. Don't you ever want to scream
and rant? Do you have to accept everything? Do you even accept the
idea that Genghis Mao is going to evict you from your own fucking
<I>head? </I>Do you&mdash;&quot; Abruptly Ficifolia checks himself,
reining himself in with a little shudder and a quick series of
jerking ticks of the facial muscles. More calmly, in an entirely
different voice, he says, &quot;Really, Shadrach, you're in big
trouble. You ought to disappear while you still can.&quot;</P>
<P>Shadrach shakes his head. &quot;Hiding's not my
style.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Is dying?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Not particularly. But I won't hide. That's
not like me. My people are done with hiding. The old Underground
Railway days are gone forever.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot; <I>'My people are done with hiding,' &quot;
</I>Ficifolia says, doing his mimicry in a harsh, high-pitched tone.
&quot;Jesus. <I>Jcsus! </I>Maybe I underestimated you. Maybe you're
as crazy as the rest of us here. Genghis Mao has fingered you for
doom, has put the old black spot right on you, and you put racial
pride ahead of survival. Bravo, Shadrach! Very noble. Very dumb.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Where could I go? The Khan's spy gadgets
will find me anywhere. Gadgets that you helped invent for him.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There are ways.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Disguise myself? Paint my skin white? Wear a
blond wig?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You could disappear the way Buckmaster did.&quot;</P>
<P>Shadrach coughs. &quot;I don't need sick jokes
just now, Frank.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'm not talking about organ farms. I mean
<I>disappearing. </I>We disappeared Buckmaster. We could do the same
for you.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Buckmaster isn't dead?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Alive and well. We altered the master
personnel register the day he was sentenced. Transposed half a dozen
binary digits and the records show that Roger Buckmaster went to the
organ farms on such-and-such day and was duly carved up. Once it's in
the record, it's realer than real. Machine reality is a higher order
of reality than reality reality. If Buckmaster shows upon any of the
Khan's scanners now, the computer will reject the data as nonsense,
because Buckmaster is known to be dead, and dead men by definition
aren't found walking around.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Where is he?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That's not important now. What's important
is that we saved him, and we can save you.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;We? Who's 'we'?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;That's not important either.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Should I believe any of this, Frank?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;No. Of course not. It's all lies. Actually,
I'm spying for the Khan, trying to trap you. Jesus, Shadrach, use
your head! Do you think I'm trying to get you into trouble? You are
in trouble. I'm risking my ass to&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;All right. Let me think, Frank.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;So think, already.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You do your hocus-pocus and I  disappear.
Now I'm without an identity and without a profession. Can I practice
medicine if I'm hiding out in some cellar? I was meant to be a
doctor. Maybe not Genghis Mao's doctor, but somebody's doctor, Frank.
If I'm not working at that, I'm nobody, I'm a waste of skills and
talent. In my own eyes I'll be nothing. Is there any point in
disappearing into that kind of life? And how long would I have to
stay underground? If I'm going to spend the rest of my life locked up
in a cellar, I wouldn't be a whole lot worse off letting Genghis Mao
use me for Avatar. Better off, maybe.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You might have to stay out of sight until
Genghis Mao dies. But afterward&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Afterward? What afterward? Genghis Mao might
live another hundred years. I won't.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;He won't either,&quot; Ficifolia says,
strange undertones of menace in his voice. Shadrach stares in wonder.
He is not sure he believes a syllable of this. Buckmaster alive?
Ficifolia a subversive? Conspiratorial plans afoot to do away with
the Khan? Questions bubble in him, and he hungers for a thousand
answers; but from the corner of his eye he perceives men in gray and
blue, two Citpols on patrol. So there will be no answers now.
Ficifolia sees them too and nods ever so slightly and says, &ldquo;Think
about it. Do your evaluating, let me know what you warn to do.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;All right.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Have you ever seen the river as high us
this?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;It was an unusually snowy winter,&quot;
Shadrach says, as the Citpols saunter past.</P>

</P>
<P><I>May 27, 2012</I></P>
<P><I>Troublesome dreams last night. Mouth full of
cobwebs, fingers growing roots. Premonitions of death. Is the end of
Genghis Mao drawing nigh? Morbid, morbid, morbid. To wake and not to
be there. The great crash of silence. It pains me. To wake and not to
be there. To have gone somewhere else. Or to have gone nowhere at
all, the big black hole. The longer one lives, the tighter one grasps
life: living becomes a habit that's hard to break. How empty the
world would be if I were to leave it. Poof, no more Genghis Mao. Such
a vacuum! Tornado. Hurricane.</I></P>
<P><I>Oh I love to dwell on death.</I></P>
<P><I>Dying can be so instructive. Dying can tell you
so very much about your true self. Dying can even be pleasurable, I
imagine. Dying as a healing experience, yes, the battered old body
gladly giving up the ghost! For some people, I imagine, it is the
sharpest ecstasy they have ever known.</I></P>
<P><I>Oh I dread it.</I></P>
<P><I>How shall I die, what will the manner of my
going be? I think I fear assassins most of all. To leave the world is
one thing, natural and inevitable; to be </I>sent <I>from it is
altogether other, an affront to the self, an insult to the ego. I
will not be able to bear that awareness of dismissal. Or the sense of
transition, the moments just before the going, the confrontation with
the killer, the contemplation of loss as he moves toward me with his
knife or his gun or whatever. Let it be a bomb, if it comes. Let it
be instant poison in my soup. But there will be no assassins. I am
guarded too well. The mistake was in not protecting Mangu the same
way. Still, Mangu wasn't Genghis Mao: his loss was not to him what my
loss will be to me. The idea of dying is alien to me. I am too large
of spirit, I occupy too great a place in the consciousness of
mankind; the subtraction of me from the world is more than the world
can accept. Certainly more than I can accept.</I></P>
<P><I>But why all this morbidity ? Strange,
considering how healthy I feel. Tremendous surge of vitality since
the aortal transplant. I thrive on surgery. I should get some sort of
organ work done every week. Change kidneys the first of every month,
new spleen on the fifteenth. Yes. Meanwhile, healthy though I am,
death plays games with my soul as I sleep. I think that it is an
amusement, a delicious sport, to toy with fantasies of death. We
require some tension in our lives to relieve that unbearable
</I>onwardness <I>of existence. That flow of event, day following
day, sunrise, noon, sunset, dark, it can be crushing, it can
stultify. And so. The delight of dwelling on the end of all
perception, that is, the end of all things. There is joy in thinking
about the dismal. Especially though not exclusively as it applies to
others. There is a German term, </I>schadenfreude, <I>the joy of
gloom, the pleasure to be had from the contemplation of the
misfortunes of others. This sorry century has been the golden age of
</I>schadenfreude. <I>We have known the ectasy of living at the end
of an era, we have shared many blessed moments of decline and
collapse. The shelling of the cathedrals in 1914, the English troops
dying in the mud, the Soviet massacres, the first great economic
disaster, the war that followed it, Auschwitz, Hiroshima, the time of
the assassinations, the toppling of the governments, the Virus War,
the organ-rot, so much to weep about, though of course always it was
others who suffered more than one's self, which makes the weeping
sweeter; nine dark decades and I have tasted them all, and why not
now achieve a bit of interior distance and turn the principle inward,
why not weep for the death of Genghis Mao? There is more pleasure in
mourning than in dying. Let me in fantasy savor my own lamentable
passing. How much I regret my going! I am my own most grief stricken
mourner. I love these fantasies; I feel so exquisitely sorry for
myself. But am I in fact dying ? I summon Shadrach. He tells me my
morning readings. Everything normal, everything healthy. I am a
phenomenon. I will not go from the world today. Long life to the
Khan! Ten thousand years to the Khan!</I></P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Bel&aacute; Horthy seeks him out in a corridor on
one of the lower floors of the Grand Tower of the Khan and says,
pretending not to be looking at him, &quot;Frank tells me that you
intend to stay here.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;For the time being,&quot; Shadrach says. &quot;I
need to think.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Thinking is useful, yes. But why do your
thinking in Ulan Bator?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It's where I live.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;For the time being,&quot; says Horthy. He
swings around and looks straight at Shadrach&mdash;boldly, daringly.
His wild hyperthyroid eyes arc veiled with concern. He must be one of
the conspirators too, Shadrach realizes, and that doesn't seem
terribly surprising at all. Horthy says softly, &quot;Run, Shadrach.&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;What's the use? They'll catch me.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Are you sure? They haven't caught Buckmaster
yet.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Aren't you afraid to say things like that?
When there might be&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Scanners in the walls?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Everything gets scanned. Everything gets
taped. So what? Who can run through all the tapes? The Citpols are
drowning in data. Every spy-channel is choked with rivers of
conspiracy, most of it insane and imaginary. There's no filtering
system to eliminate the useless noise.&quot; Horthy winks. &quot;Go.
As Buckmaster went.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Useless.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I don't think so. I advise running. I
<I>strongly </I>advise running. You know, some people think better
when they're on the run.&quot;</P>
<P>Horthy smiles. He takes Shadrach's hand for a
moment. As Horthy walks away, Shadrach calls after him, &quot;Hey,
are you part of it too?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Part of what?&quot; Horthy asks, and laughs.
</P>

</P>
<P><I>May 28, 2012</I></P>
<P><I>More dark dreams. I went down to Sukhe Bator
Square and found they had erected a statue of me in the center of the
plaza, a colossus, at least a hundred meters high, made of bronze
that was already developing a green patina. My arms outspread in
benediction. My face looked awful: wrinkled, cavernous, hideous, the
face of a man five hundred years old. And the statue had no legs. It
ended at mid-thigh, Genghis Mao on stumps, </I>but the statue floated
in mid-air, <I>as though the legs had once been there but had been
chopped away and the statue had remained at its original height.
There was an old workman, sweeping up faded flowers, and I said to
him, &quot;Is Genghis Mao dead?&quot; and he said, &quot;Dead and
gone, they sent the pieces back to Dalan-Dzadagad, and good
riddance.&quot; The pieces. They sent the pieces back. I don't like
this. There is too much death in my head these days. The game has
lost its savor. I must take steps.</I></P>
<P><I>After breakfast I decided to make an inspection
of the project laboratories. When preoccupied with death, drop in on
those who would help you live forever. Wise idea. Immediately felt
better. First personal visit in months. Should go more often.</I></P>
<P><I>Called on Phoenix first, the dainty Sarafrazi
woman in charge, marvelous eyes, beautiful face. Terrified of me.
Showed me her monkeys, her bubbling vats of chemicals, her pickled
brains in bell jars. Optimistic forecasts from her, delivered in
tense throaty voice. She'll make me young again, so she claims. Am
not so sure of that but told her to keep at it. Paralyzed with awe,
she was. I thought she was almost going to kneel as I left. Went from
there to Talos. Came in unannounced, but the Lindman woman cool as
ice anyway. The report is that she's Shadrach's new lover. Can't
understand what he sees in her. Something about her mouth I don't
like, spoils her face. Looks like the mouth of some ferocious gnawing
creature. She's got a plastic Genghis Mao in her lab, very large,
nothing finished below the waist, fust framework there, no legs. </I>No
legs. <I>The Genghis Mao Memorial Statue. &rdquo;Finish the legs,'' I
told her. She gave me a peculiar look. Told me the legs were the
final job, more important now to get the internal engineering done.
Knows her own mind, won't take nonsense from me. Even if I am
Chairman of the Permanent Revolutionary Committee. I Genghis II Mao
IV Khan do command</I>&mdash;<I>no. Her robot can wink, smile, wave
its arms. Gonchigdorge was with me and said, &quot;It's just like
you, sir, a remarkable likeness,&quot; but I can't agree. Ingenious
but mechanical. I wouldn't want it to succeed me, I will not
terminate Project Talos, not yet at any rate, but I don't think it's
going to be able to produce what I need.</I></P>
<P><I>Went on to Nikki Crowfoot's lab. Avatar. Ah!
Yes!Beautiful woman, though tense, depressed, withdrawn, these days.
Guilty about Shadrach, I imagine. She ought to be. But she remains a
loyal servant of the Khan. Is this a good thing? &quot;When will you
be ready to make the transfer?&quot; I asked her. She said, &quot;It's
just a matter of months.'' I felt such a surge of excitement at that
that Shadrach phoned from upstairs to find out if I was all right.
Told him to mind his own business. But I am his own business. Anyway,
Avatar gives me hope. Soon I will put on new healthy flesh. Before
the first snows come I will speak to the world with Shadrach's lips,
I will breathe the air with Shadrach's lungs.</I></P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Entering the Project Avatar laboratory unannounced
in midafternoon, Shadrach is confronted immediately by Manfred Eis,
Nikki Crowfoot's chief assistant, who emerges out of a maze of
equipment and strides purposefully toward him like Thor on the
warpath, halting with a crispness just short of a heel-click.</P>
<P>&quot;We are very busy just now,&quot; Eis
announces, making a challenge out of it.</P>
<P>&quot;I'm glad to hear it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;'You have come because&mdash;?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;A routine inspection visit,&quot; Shadrach
answers mildly. &quot;To check on progress. I haven't been here for a
while.&quot;</P>
<P>In fact it is several weeks since he was last in
the Avatar lab, not since just before Mangu's death, and the rhythm
of his schedule has usually brought him to each project af least once
a month. But Eis hardly makes him feel welcome now. He is a
cold-mannered, humorless man at best, a cliche-Teuton, stiff and
square-jawed and square-shouldered and very Nordic, with frosty blue
eyes, pearly teeth, long yellow hair, everything but the dueling
scar. Shadrach is accustomed to Dr. Eis's Aryan brusqueness, but
today there is something new in his manner, something gratuitously
hostile, almost patronizing, vaguely contemptuous, that Shadrach
finds disturbing because he suspects it has to do with his own
suddenly significant personal involvement in the destinies of Project
Avatar. 
</P>
<P>Eis is <I>pleased </I>that Shadrach has been
chosen. Eis is <I>gratified. </I>Eis thinks it altogether <I>proper
</I>that Shadrach should be the one. That's it. Perhaps it was Eis
who actually sold Genghis Mao on the idea of selecting Shadrach. No,
no, an underling like Eis would never have had access to the
Chairman; but still, Eis most have rejoiced, seems still to be
rejoicing right now. Shadrach does not like being gloated over. He
wonders if it is possible to find some appropriate experimental use
for Eis's fine Nordic body.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, Shadrach is nominally in charge
here, and Eis must give ground. Busy though the lab is, he will have
to let Shadrach make his inspection. The place really is busy, too,
frantic, all sorts of experiments with all sorts of animals under
way, while electronic gear is hauled from room to room by sweating,
cursing technicians, and men and women in lab smocks run around
wild-eyed, brandishing sheafs of printouts&mdash; a real circus,
altogether manic and comic, mad scientists at work, desperately
striving to square the circle before the onrushing deadline arrives.</P>
<P>It makes Shadrach queasy to realize that <I>he </I>is
the circle they must square. He is the patsy, the sucker, the victim,
whose life is eventually going to be swallowed by all this equipment,
and the manic tone of the current Avatar operations is entirely the
result of the need to convert everything, fast, from Mangu-parameters
to Shadrach-parameters. Probably a dozen people here know as much
about his body, his brain-wave patterns and his neural circuitry and
his serotonin levels, as he does himself. Quite likely he has been
under covert scrutiny for days. (Do they steal nail parings? Hair
clippings?) Shadrach wonders how many of these technicians know of
the host substitution. He imagines that they all do, that they are
eyeing him with secret fascination even as they rush to and fro&mdash;that
they are sizing him up, comparing the authentic actual Shadrach
Mordecai to the clusters of abstract and synthetic
Shadrach-simulation pulsations that they have been working with. But
maybe not. Apparently only a few of the Avatar people knew that Mangu
was going to be the body donor in the first place, and most likely
even fewer have been allowed to learn the identity of Mangu's
replacement.</P>
<P>Nikki, at any rate, is not caught up in the
general manic mood. Summoned by Eis, she greets Shadrach quite
calmly. The project, she tells him, is making steady progress. Her
gaze is steady, her voice is centered and composed. &quot;Progress,&quot;
in this laboratory, can only mean the daily process of bringing
Shadrach closer to destruction, and certainly she is aware that he
will put that interpretation on it; but it seems that she has decided
not to feel guilty or act evasive any longer. They have already had
their showdown; she has admitted that she was willing to betray her
lover for the sake of Genghis Mao; now life continues&mdash;for
however long&mdash;and she has her job to do. All this passes between
them within the space of ninety seconds, and none of it is
communicated in words, only in tone of voice and expression of eyes.
Shadrach is relieved. He does not enjoy making people feel guilty; it
makes him feel obscurely guilty himself. &quot;I should look at the
equipment,&quot; Shadrach says. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Come.&quot;</P>
<P>She takes him on a guided tour. She demonstrates
for him the zoo of metempsychosized animals, the latest triumphs of
electronic transmigration: here is a dog with rhe soul of a raccoon,
diligently dipping its dinner in a pan of wafer, and here is an eagle
with a coded peacock-construct in its skull to make it strut and
preen and spread its wings, and here they have slipped the essential
sheepness of a sheep into a young lioness, who sits placidly munching
fodder, to the probable detriment of her digestive system. All these
reborn beasts have a trapped, bewildered look, as though they are
being gnawed from within by some insatiable parasite, and Shadrach
asks Nikki if this is going to be a characteristic of human avatars
as well, if the expunged soul of the body donor will not linger as a
miasma to complicate the life of his supplanter.</P>
<P>&quot;We don't think so,&quot; Nikki says.
&quot;Remember, all the animals I've shown you have undergone implant
codings across species lines, in fact across generic lines. A peacock
is <I>never </I>going to be comfortable in an eagle's body, or a
sheep in a lion's. Eventually the animal gets the hang of operating
its new body, but it'll always tend to keep reverting to the old
reflex patterns.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Then why bother with transgeneric switches?
What's the point, other than showing off how clever you are?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The point is that the disparities between
the implanted entity and the host are so gross that we can instantly
confirm the success of the implant. If we put a spaniel's mind into
another spaniel's body, if we put a chimp into a chimp, a goat into a
goat, how do we know if we've accomplished anything? The goat can't
tell us. The spaniel can't tell us.&quot;</P>
<P>Shadrach frowns. &quot;Surely the electrical
pattern of one spaniel's brain is different from another's, and that
can readily be detected. If brain-wave patterns aren't unique to the
individual, what's your whole project all about?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Of course the patterns are unique,&quot;
Crowfoot says. &quot;But we need confirmation on gross behavioral
level. We <I>have </I>done intraspecies coding and implants, plenty
of them, but the behavioral differences after the implant are too
subtle to prove very much when we put one chimp into another, say,
and the brainwave changes that we can detect are, for all we know,
just artifacts of our own meddling. Whereas if we code a sheep and
feed her into a lioness, and the lioness is thereupon transformed 
into a grazing animal, we have very dramatic confirmation that we've
achieved something. Yes?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But it would be very much more dramatic,
naturally, if the minds you were switching around were human ones.
And much easier to confirm that a switch has actually been induced.&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;Naturally.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Only you haven't done any of that,&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Not yet,&quot; Nikki says. &quot;Next week,
I think, we'll tackle our first human implant.&quot;</P>
<P>Shadrach feels a faint chill. He has managed an
admirable impersonality thus far on this tour, he has carried on this
conversation exactly as though his interest in Project Avatar is a
purely professional one; but it is not that easy to escape an
awareness of the ultimate consequences of all this painstaking
research,  that he and Crowfoot have begun talking of moving human
minds from one body to another. He is unable to ignore the final goal
of Avatar, the transmigration of tiger into gazelle: Genghis Mao is
the tiger, and he himself the hapless gazelle. What becomes of the.
gazelle when the tiger invades? Shadrach examines, briefly, one
avenue of escape that he had not previously considered: if they can
move sheep-mind to lioness-body and Genghis Mao-mind to
Shadrach-body, they can just as easily move Shadrach-mind to some
other body, and leave him to proceed from there. But the fantasy
fades in the instant of its birth. He does not want to move to
another body. He wants to keep his own. How like a dream this is, he
thinks. Except that there is no awakening from it.</P>
<P>&quot;How long will you do experiments in human
implants,&rdquo; Shadrach asks, &quot;before you'll be ready to&mdash;to&mdash;&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;To transplant the Chairman?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes.&quot;</P>
<P>Shrugging, Nikki says, &quot;That's hard to
answer. It depends on the problems we encounter in the early human
transplants. If there are unexpectedly difficult problems of
psychological adaptation, if transplant leads to psychotic freak-outs
or cerebral breakdown or identity bleed-throughs or anything like
that, it might be months or even years before we dare shift Genghis
Mao to a new body. Our animal experiments haven't indicated that such
things are going to happen, but human minds are more complex than
spaniel minds, and we have to allow for the possibility that complex
minds will react in complicated ways to something as traumatic as a
shift of bodies. So we'll proceed cautiously. Unless, of course, the
imminent bodily death of Genghis Mao makes an emergency
mind-transplant necessary, in which case, I suppose, we'll just have
to plunge ahead and see what happens. We're not eager to do that, of
course.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Of course,&quot; Shadrach echoes dryly. 
</P>
<P>&quot;We'd much rather be orderly about it. A
period of experimentation with human subjects, and then, if all goes
smoothly there, we'd like to do two or three preliminary Genghis Mao
transplants before we&mdash;&quot; 
</P>
<P><I>&quot;What?&quot;</I></P>
<P>&quot;Yes. Insert the Genghis Mao construct into
several temporary host bodies, simply to find out how the Chairman
reacts when transplanted, what adaptations may be required in order
to&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And what will you do with all these extra
Genghis Maos?&quot; Shadrach asks. &quot;It's beautiful redundancy, I
know, to keep a stockpile of them around. But if they all start
giving orders at once we might&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, no,&quot; Crowfoot says. &quot;We don't
intend to let the Genghis Mao material remain in any of the
experimental subjects. That sort of redundancy is absolutely not
wanted here. We'd expunge each subject once we were done testing him.
We'd do a complete mindpick after we've run our tests.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Ah. Yes. Assuming the subject will let you.&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Remember, you won't be dealing with a
helpless flunky, once you've done your transplant. You'll be dealing
with Genghis Mao wearing a new body. You'll be up against the
dominant spirit of the age. You might have problems.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I doubt it,&quot; Nikki says breezily.
&quot;We'll take precautions. Come this way, will you?&quot;</P>
<P>She leads him forward, to a vast computer bank, a
wall of gray-green metal studded with incomprehensible apparatus. In
here, she tells him, the coded essence of Genghis Mao is stored,
everything that has been recorded so far, a nearly complete digital
persona-construct that is capable of responding to stimuli precisely
as the living Genghis Mao would, to a probability of seven or eight
decimal places. Nikki offers to demonstrate the constructs Genghis
Mao-ness with a few quick simulation runs, but Shadrach, suddenly
disheartened, shows little interest; she marches him on to some of
the other Avatar wonders, to which he reacts with no greater
enthusiasm, and, as though at last noticing that Shadrach has ceased
to pretend to be delighted by her technological miracles, she ushers
him into her private office and locks the door.</P>
<P>They stand facing each other, less than a meter
apart, and he feels sudden surprising excitement, physical, intense.
The intensity astounds him. He had thought all desire for her had
gone from him forever, once he discovered how she had betrayed him.
But no. Still there, strong as ever. The lore of her sleek tawny
body, the memory of her fragrance, the glitter of her huge piercing
dark eyes. His Indian princess, Pocahontas. Sacajawea. Even now he is
drawn to her, even now. He ceases to see the ingenious woman of
science whose ingenuity has altogether undone him; he sees only the
woman, beautiful, passionate, irresistible. He feels the pull of her
body and he is sure she feels the pull of his.</P>
<P>It ought not to be such a surprise. Here they are,
man and woman; they have been lovers for many months; they are alone,
the door is locked. Why should desire not come over them, despite
everything? But still, this sudden shifting of gears into the erotic
mode amazes him. Somehow sex, unexpectedly obtruding itself against
this background of betrayal, depression, impending doom, seems
irrelevant and inappropriate, bizarre and unwelcome. He pretends he
feels nothing. He makes no move.</P>
<P>&quot;How are you managing, Shadrach?&quot; she
asks tenderly, after a moment. &quot;Is it very bad?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I'm holding on.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Are you frightened?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;A little. More angry than frightened, I
guess.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Do you hate me?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I don't hate anyone. I'm not a hater.&quot;</P>
<P><I>&quot;</I>I still love you, you know.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Quit it, Nikki.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I do. That's what's been ripping me apart
for weeks.&quot;</P>
<P>The force of Crowfoot's concern for him is like a
tangible presence in the small office.</P>
<P>&quot;I don't want to hear about it,&quot; he
says.</P>
<P>&quot;You do hate me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No. I'm just not interested in your
remorse.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Or my love?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Such that it is.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Such that it is.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I don't know,&quot; he says. &quot;I don't
want my head messed up any more than it already has been.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What will you do, Shadrach?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What do you mean, what will I do?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You aren't going to stay in Ulan Bator.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Everybody's been telling me to run.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It wouldn't do any good.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;You could save yourself,&quot; Crowfoot
tells him.</P>
<P>He shakes his head. &quot;I wouldn't get away. The
whole planet's bugged, Nikki. Watch Surveillance Vector One for
fifteen minutes and you'll realize that. You know that already.
You've told me yourself that escape's impossible. There's a tracer on
everyone. Anyway, it would spoil your project again if I
disappeared.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, Shadrach!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I mean, I'm the key man, right?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Don't be an idiot.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You'd have to find another host for Genghis
Mao. Then you'd have to recalibrate all over again. You&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Stop it. Please.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;All right,&quot; he says. &quot;At any rate,
it's futile to try to escape from the Khan.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You won't even try?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I won't even try.&quot;</P>
<P>Crowfoot regards him levelly for a long silent
moment. Then she says, &quot;I should feel relieved about that, I
suppose.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Why?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;If you won't take responsibility for saving
yourself, then I don't have to take responsibility for&mdash;for&mdash;&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;For what's going to happen to me if I stay
here?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That's right. You don't need to feel any
guilt at all. I've had fair warning, and nevertheless I freely choose
to stay and face the music. You're absolved, Nikki. Your hands are
washed of my blood.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Are you being sarcastic, Shadrach?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Not particularly.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I can never tell when you're being
sarcastic.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Not this time.&quot;' he says.</P>
<P>They stare at each other strangely again. He still
feels that mysterious sexual tension, that grotesque and
inappropriate lust. He suspects that if he reached for her and
dragged her down on the carpeted floor, down between the desk and the
filing cabinets, he could have her right here, right now, in her own
office, one last crazy and frantic screw. Then he thinks of Eis and
his colleagues running around on the other side of the locked office
door, busy with their computers and their chimps, doing simulated
transfers of the persona of Genghis Mao into the bodily hull of
Shadrach Mordecai, and his ardor cools a little. But only a little.
Nikki laughs. 
</P>
<P>&quot;What's funny?&quot; he asks.</P>
<P>&quot;Do you remember,&quot; she says, &quot;that
time we spoke about the concept of you and Genghis Mao being one life
system, one self-corrective information-processing unit? That was
before any of this happened. Mangu was still alive, I think. I talked
about how the chisel and the mallet and the stone are aspects of the
sculptor, or, more precisely, that the sculptor and his tools and
materials together make up a single thinking and acting entity, a
single <I>person, </I>and how you and Genghis Mao&mdash;&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes. I remember.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It's going to be even truer now, won't it?
In the most literal sense. That seems awfully ironic to me. Your
nervous system and his, entwined, interlocked, indistinguishable.
When we spoke then, you said no, it wasn't a true analogy, that
Genghis Mao can send data to you but you can't send it to him, so
that there's a limitation on the information flow, a discrete
boundary. That'll change, now. It'll be impossible to tell where one
of you leaves off and the other begins. But even then, I wanted to
tell you that you weren't really grasping the idea&mdash;that the
marble can't design a sculpture but is nevertheless part of the total
sculpture-making system, and that you can't feed metabolic data into
Genghis Mao but are nevertheless part of the total Genghis Mao
system; there <I>is </I>an interaction, there is a feedback
relationship that links you to him and he to you, there is&mdash;''
She has been talking very rapidly, a torrential flow of words. Now
she halts and in an altogether different voice says, &quot;Oh,
Shadrach, why don't you want to hide yourself?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I told you. It's useless. I keep telling
people that, but they don't seem to want to believe me.&quot;</P>
<P>He thinks about himself as part of the total
Genghis Mao system. He considers the analogies. No doubt of it, his
sensors and implants link him to the Khan in a very special way. But
he is no more&mdash;and no less&mdash;important to the total Genghis
Mao system than Michelangelo's lump of marble was to the total
statue-making system. Michelangelo, if he fell that a given lump of
marble was no longer necessary to the needs of the total system,
would casually discard it and introduce another into the system.</P>
<P>Nikki is trembling.</P>
<P>&quot;If you won't try to save yourself,&quot; she
says, &quot;then nobody else can do anything for you.&quot;</P>
<P>After he and Genghis Mao come to share one body,
they will truly be an integrated information-processing unit. Of
course, such a unit needs only one biocomputer, one brain, one mind,
one self. And that self will not be the self of Shadrach Mordecai.</P>
<P>He says, &quot;I know that. We've already
discussed that. I take full responsibility.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Don't you <I>care?&quot; </I>
</P>
<P>&quot;Maybe not. Not any longer. I don't know.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Shadrach&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>She starts to reach toward him, a tentative
gesture, perhaps sexual, perhaps merely some sort of reflexive grab
at a sinking man. He pulls back. There is a wall between them, an
impermeable barrier of words and fears and doubts and hesitations and
guilts. He does not mind that. He takes refuge behind that wall. But
still there is that sexual pull between them, that taut hot line of
erotic tension, spanning the barrier, drilling through it, eroding
it, breaching it. And then the barrier is gone. He loves her, he
hates her, he wants her, he loathes her. He makes a tentative gesture
toward her and halts. They are like two adolescents, absurdly unsure
of themselves, feinting foolishly, making silly false starts and
finicky nervous withdrawals. He smiles tensely. So does she. She is
obviously as conscious as he is of the minute shifts of balance that
are rapidly occurring within them and between them. It is as though
they are voyagers aboard an ocean liner that is struggling through
turbulent, stormy waters, and they are trapped together in a tiny
cabin with a massive metal safe that slides wildly about, careening
across the floor with every convulsion of the waves, crashing into
the walls as they jump about, threatening to crush them if they do
not succeed in scampering out of its way as it bears down on them.
There is something undeniably comic about their predicament, but the
peril is real, too, and not at all funny. How much longer can they
hold out? The safe is so heavy, the sea so rough, the cabin so small,
and they are getting weary&mdash;</P>
<P>And suddenly they come together, embracing,
grappling, mouth seeking mouth, fingers digging furiously into flesh.
He is terrified by the power of the blind, irrational force that has
been unleashed in him, that he has unleashed in himself. &quot;No,&quot;
he mutters, even as he claws at her clothes, even as he pushes
himself against her, even as he finds the fullness of her breasts
beneath the sexless lab smock. &quot;No,&quot; she whimpers,
seemingly equally appalled. But neither of them resists. They stumble
about ridiculously, sway, topple to the floor. On the carpet, between
the desk and the filing cabinet.</P>
<P>Neither of them undresses. Down with zipper, up
with skirt; this is no tender act of love, this is not even a display
of sexual athleticism, this is mere savage coupling, a desperate and
unsophisticated cleaving-together of flesh. His hands slide along the
smooth firm columns of her thighs and his fingers find and probe the
secret slit between them, already hot and moist, and she gasps and
thrusts her pelvis at him and, quickly, blindly, he drives himself
into her. There is barely room for their bodies to move on the floor;
she tilts herself upward, feet pointed at the ceiling, and he reaches
below to grasp her buttocks, supporting her, and rams himself against
her with lunatic vigor. Almost at once, so it seems to him, she comes
with unfamiliar little shivers and giggles, and moments later so does
he, in wild galvanic spasms that wrench a hoarse strained cry from
him. Inelegantly Shadrach slumps down on her chest, exhausted, and
she holds him tightly, with loving rocklike patience, as if she would
be willing to hold him this way for hours or weeks, but after two or
three minutes he pulls free, stunned, dazed, hardly believing what
has just passed between them.</P>
<P>They look at each other. He blinks; so does she.
There are thin faint smiles of embarrassment.</P>
<P>Shakily he rises. Nikki lies there, her legs
lowered now but still spread wide, her rumpled skirt pushed up around
her hips, her face shiny with sweat, her eyes bloodshot, unfocused.
Shadrach averts his glance from her body in peculiar fastidiousness:
he is not exactly repelled by the sight of her exposed loins, but
somehow he does not want to look. Perhaps he is frightened by the
power that that dark hairy humid cavern has over him, the primordial
female chasm, irresistible, all-engulfing. At any rate he adjusts his
clothes, coughs self-consciously, stoops to offer Nikki a helping
hand. She shakes him off gently and gets to her feet unaided, and
they stand facing each other. He has nothing to say. It is a sticky
moment, but she rescues them from it by taking his hand, by giving
him a warm loving smile, by pulling him toward her for a quick chaste
kiss, lips lightly brushing lips, a kiss that simultaneously
acknowledges the intensity of what has just taken place and brings
down a curtain on it. It is time for him logo.</P>
<P>&quot;Save yourself,&quot; she whispers. &quot;No
one can do it for you.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I need to think about things some more.&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;Go, then. Do your thinking. I love you,
Shadrach.&quot; 
</P>
<P>He knows what he is supposed to reply to that, but
the words are impossible. He squeezes her fingers instead. And
swiftly leaves.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3><I>19</I></H3>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>He has been saying for days that he will not run
away. He has said it to Ficifolia, to Horthy, to Nikki, to Katya, to
all of the well-meaning friends who want him to try to save himself.
But then he decides to get out of Ulan Bator after all.</P>
<P>It is not exactly an escape attempt, for Shadrach
still believes there is no way ultimately of avoiding the spy-eyes of
Genghis Mao. He will not try to be secretive about it: he intends
even to notify the Chairman himself that he is going. No, it is more
like a holiday trip, a vacation. Shadrach is going to go because of
that remark of Horthy's&mdash;<I>some people think better when
they're on the run</I>&mdash;and because Nikki, once again bringing
up her notion that he and Genghis Mao constitute a single system, has
given him some ideas. He is not sure how useful the ideas may be, and
he needs to consider them at length. Perhaps he really will think
better on the run. He will go, at any rate. He looks forward to the
trip. It will be a diverting entertainment, and possibly instructive
as well. He feels buoyant and cheerful. Shadrach the Glorious,
striding splendidly from continent to continent in what may very well
be the last great adventure of his life.</P>
<P>In the evening he visits Genghis Mao. The Khan is
making his usual magnificent recovery from his latest surgery. He
looks a little feverish, a trifle flushed, his keen narrow eyes
unnaturally glossy, but generally he appears hale, vigorous, alert.
He has spent much of the day going over the plans for the spectacular
state funeral of Mangu, postponed on account of the aortal transplant
and now scheduled for ten days hence. As Shadrach runs through his
brisk diagnostic routines, the palpation and the auscultation and all
the rest, Genghis Mao, shuffling documents and paying no attention to
his physician's earnest probings, speaks with bubbling boyish
enthusiasm of the great occasion. &quot;Fifty thousand troops massed
in the plaza, Shadrach! Rockets going back and forth overhead,
flights of military planes, a thousand flags, six separate marching
bands. Lights, color, excitement. The whole Committee on the dais
under a tremendous purple-and-gold spotlight. The catafalque drawn by
thirteen wild Mongol mares. Platoons of archers, a canopy of fiery
arrows. An immense pyre on the very spot where Mangu fell. Teams of
gymnasts who&mdash;&quot; The Khan pauses. &quot;You aren't going to
find something new to slice out of me, are you? I don't want any more
surgery just now. The funeral mustn't be postponed a second time.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I see no reason why it should be, sir.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Good. Good. It's going to be an event to be
remembered for centuries. Whenever a great man dies, they'll talk
about giving him a funeral as great as the funeral of Mangu. You'll
sit beside me on the dais, Shadrach. At my right hand. A special mark
of my favor, and everyone will know it.&quot;</P>
<P>Shadrach takes a deep breath. This may be
difficult.</P>
<P>&quot;With your permission, sir, I intend not to
be in Ulan Bator when the funeral takes place.&quot;</P>
<P>The imperial eyebrows lift in surprise, but only
for a moment.</P>
<P>&quot;Oh?&quot; says Genghis Mao, finally.</P>
<P>&quot;I want to get away for a while,&quot;
Shadrach tells him. &quot;I've been under a lot of stress lately.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You do look pale,&quot; The Khan says dryly.</P>
<P>&quot;Very tense. Very tired.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes. Poor Shadrach. How devoted you are.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You've grown much stronger since the liver
transplant, sir. You won't be needing me on a day-by-day basis in the
weeks just ahead. And of course I could get back to Ulan Bator in a
hurry if there's any emergency.&quot;</P>
<P>The beady eyes study him calmly. The Khan is oddly
undisturbed by Shadrach's announcement, it would seem. There is
something mildly disquieting about that. Shadrach does not want to be
indispensable, with all the burdens that indispensability entails,
but on the other hand he wishes the Khan would <I>think </I>of him as
indispensable. His only salvation now lies in indispensability.</P>
<P>&quot;Where will you go?&quot; Genghis Mao asks.</P>
<P>&quot;I haven't decided that yet.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Not even tentatively?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Not even tentatively. Away from here, that's
all I know.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I see. And for how long?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;A few weeks. A month, at most.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;It will be strange, not having you at my
side.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Then I have your permission to go, sir?&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;You have my permission. Of course.&quot; The
Khan smiles serenely, as if very satisfied with his own graciousness.
And then a sudden mercurial shift, a darkening of the face, furrowing
of the forehead, a tense fretful gleam coming into the eyes. Second
thoughts? Yes. &quot;But what if I do fall ill? Suppose I have a
stroke. Suppose my heart. My stomach.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Sir, I can return at once if&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It worries me, Shadrach. Not having you
close by.&quot; The Khan's voice is hoarse, ragged, almost panicky
now. &quot;If organ rejection starts. If there's some intestinal
obstruction. If my kidneys begin to fail. You know of trouble so
soon, you react so swiftly. If&mdash;&quot; The Khan laughs. His mood
seems to be shifting again; the fears of a moment ago vanish
abruptly, and a strange blank smile plays across his face. In a new,
sweet voice he says, almost crooning, &quot;Sometimes I hear voices,
Shadrach, did you know that? Like the saints, like the prophets.
Invisible advisers come to me. Whispering, Whispering. They always
have, in time of need. To warn me, to guide me.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Voices, sir?&quot;</P>
<P>Genghis Mao blinks. &quot;Did you say something?&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;<I>Voices, </I>I said. You were telling me
that you sometimes hear voices.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&quot;I said that? I said nothing about voices.
What voices? What are you talking about, Shadrach?&quot; Genghis Mao
laughs again, a low, harsh, baffling laugh. &quot;Voices! What
madness! Well, let's not trouble ourselves with such foolishness.''
He cranes his neck and peers straight up at Shadrach. &quot;So you'll
be having a vacation from the old man and his complaints soon, will
you?&quot;</P>
<P>Shadrach is sweating. Shadrach is terrified. Is
this some kind of psychotic break, or merely one of Genghis Mao's
games?</P>
<P>&quot;A short vacation, yes, sir,&quot; he says
uncertainly. 
</P>
<P>The Chairman looks momentarily wistful. &quot;Yes.
But to miss the funeral, though&mdash;such a pity&mdash;&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I regret that,&quot; Shadrach says. &quot;But
I do need to get away,&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes. Yes. By all means. Take your trip,
Shadrach. If you do need to get away. If you do. Need to get away.&quot;
</P>
<P>There. Done. Shadrach sighs. An uneasy moment or
two, but he has his permission to depart. Strange. That wasn't really
so difficult at all.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><I>May 29, 2012</I></P>
<P><I>Such a long face on Shadrach when he came out
with the business about his vacation. Terrified of me. Afraid I'd
refuse, I guess. What would he have done if I'd said no? Go anyway?
He might. He seems desperate. Had that look in his eye, trapped man
fighting in a corner. One must always be wary of those. Control your
opponent, yes, but don't</I> <I>trap him in corners. Give him plenty
of space. That way you give yourself plenty of space, too.</I></P>
<P><I>I wonder why he's going.</I></P>
<P><I>Tired, he said. Tense. Well, maybe so. But
there's more to it than that. It has to have something to do with
Avatar. Is he thinking of disappearing? He's too bright for that.
Must know he can't disappear. What then? Rebelliousness? Wants to see
what happens if he walks in and tells the old man he's taking off for
a month to points unknown? Naturally I wouldn't refuse. Much more
interesting to let him go and see what he does.</I></P>
<P><I>First flicker of independence poor Shadrach's
ever shown. About time, too.</I></P>
<P><I>What if I get seriously ill while he's gone?
Heart. Liver. Lungs. Kidneys. Cerebral hemorrhage. Pleurisy. Acute
pericarditis. Toxicuremia. So fragile, so flimsy, so vulnerable, this
body, just chunks of meat strung together. Capable of falling apart
overnight.</I></P>
<P><I>Mustn't worry about that. I feel fine. I feel
fine. I feel fine. I am in extraordinarily good health.</I></P>
<P><I>I am not dependent on Shadrach Mordecai.</I></P>
<P><I>I am not dependent on Shadrach Mordecai.</I></P>
<P><I>And what if he knows some way of actually
disappearing? I suppose there's at least a slight chance of that.
What becomes of Avatar then? Find another donor? But I want </I>him.
<I>Whenever I see him, I think of how fine his body is, how agile,
how elegant. I mean to wear that body someday, oh, yes!</I></P>
<P><I>Should I therefore let him get out of my sight?</I></P>
<P><I>No one can get out of my sight. Right.</I></P>
<P><I>Anyway, I </I>know <I>Shadrach. It doesn 't
worry me, this trip of his. He'll go, he'll have his fling, and then
he'll come back to me. Of his own free will. He'll come back, all
right. Yes. Of his own free will.</I></P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>It is time to think of the choosing of
destinations. Shadrach can go anywhere in the world, and no concern
for the cost; he is a member of the ruling elite, is he not,
Antidote-blessed, an aristocrat in a world of rotting pieces. But
where shall he go? He heads for Surveillance Vector One to consider
his options. Though he has often paused before the screens of
Surveillance Vector One for a random dip into the activities of the
outer world that he calls the Trauma Ward, this is the first time
that Shadrach has actually seated himself in the imperial throne from
which the great spy-eye apparatus is controlled. Scores, perhaps
hundreds, of colored buttons confront him: a bank of red ones, a
wedge of green ones, yellow, blue, violet, orange. His hands hover
above them like those of a novice organist approaching a full
keyboard for the first time. Nothing is labeled. Is there a system?
All about the room, images whirl and flit on the myriad screens,
zipping by at unfathomable variable rates. Shadrach pokes a green
button. Has anything been accomplished? The screens still seem
random. He covers dozens of green buttons with both palms
outstretched. Ah. Now there seems to be a detectable pattern of
response. One slice of screens high up and to his right is showing
unmistakably European cities&mdash;Paris, London, maybe Prague,
Vienna, Stockholm. The color-coding, then, may be keyed to
continents.</P>
<P>Leaving the green keys depressed, Shadrach punches
a bunch of orange ones. A systematic search through the whirling
madness of the blinking screens shows him, eventually, a bloc of
North American scenery far to his left&mdash;glimpses of Los Angeles,
surely, and New York, and Chicago, Boston, Pittsburgh. So. Yes.</P>
<P>Half an hour of patient, absorbing work and he has
mastered the system; he is a quick study. Violet is Africa, yellow is
Asia, red is Latin America, and so on. He discovers, also, that there
are certain master buttons&mdash;the red of red, so to speak, the
blue of blues&mdash;which, when punched, wipe from the screens all
data on continents other than the one covered by keys of that color,
so that one need not contend with the crazy oversufficiency of
information that the whole of Surveillance Vector One is capable of
supplying. He learns, also, how to summon images of particular
cities: the keys within each color group are arranged in a
geographical analogue of their actual positions, and by activating a
screen at his left elbow he can call for maps, divided into grids
that show him which buttons to push. And then he systematically
examines the Trauma Ward to see where he wants to go.</P>
<P>The famous cities of the world, yes. The ancient
capitals. Rome? Of course. He punches for it. The Colosseum flashes
by, the Forum, the Spanish Steps. Yes. And Jerusalem, yes, one
glimpse is enough. He considers Egypt and punches for Cairo, but
rejects it when he sees the beggars shambling about the base of the
Great Pyramid, their blind eyes crusted with swarming flies. He has
heard rumors about Egypt, and they seem to be true: organ-rot does
not frighten him, but he has no antidotes for the ghastly trachoma,
for the endemic bilharziasis, for the thousand other Cairene plagues
that the screens show him. The healer in him might be willing enough
to go to Egypt for a laying on of hands, a spraying on of medicines,
but this is meant to be a holiday, he is going abroad not as a doctor
but as an anti-doctor, and he shies from that challenge. No Egypt.
But he chooses Istanbul after a view of the plump mosques rising from
the hills; he picks London; bypasses his native Philadelphia and,
with a shudder, New York; elects San Francisco; and finally Peking.
The grand tour. The great adventure.</P>
<P>He sleeps alone that night, and for a change he
sleeps well, as if the prospect of world-girdling travel has
perversely calmed his restless spirit. Before dawn he awakens, does
some perfunctory calisthenics, packs quickly, taking little with him.
The green face of the data screen tells him it is</P>
<H5>FRIDAY</H5>
<H5><I>1 June, 2012</I></H5>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>He does not bother with farewells. Just as the sun
breaks the horizon he summons a car and is taken to the airport.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><I>June 1, 2012</I></P>
<P><I>I did tell him about the voices after all.
Despite earlier resolves. Should I have told him</I>? <I>But he
didn't take me seriously. Do I take me seriously? Do I take </I>them
<I>seriously? Perhaps they are symptoms of some grave mental
disorder. But were the saints mad too, then? The voices whisper to
me. They have always come to me in times of crisis. During the Virus
War I heard them most dearly. One voice said, I am Temujin Genghis
Khan, and you are my son, and you shall be Genghis II. A voice of
thunder, though he only whispered. And I am Mao, another voice said,
smooth as silk. You are my son, Mao said, and you shall be Mao II.
But we had already had a Mao II, nasty little coward, completely
destroved his country with his idiocies, and there was even a Mao
III, briefly, during the days just before the outbreak of the Virus
War, so I answered Mao, I told him he was behind the times, it was
too late for me to be Mao II, I must become Mao IV. He understood. So
they blessed me and anointed me. Genghis II Mao IV, I became. So my
voices dubbed and ordained and anointed me. And they have guided me.
Is it a sign of schizoid disturbance to hear disembodied voices? It
could be. Am I schizoid, then? Very well, I am schizoid. But I am
also Genghis II Mao IV</I>, <I>and I rule the world.</I></P>

<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>No flights are due to depart that morning,
Shadrach learns, for Jerusalem, Istanbul, Rome, or any plausible
connecting points to those destinations. There is a flight to Peking
soon, but Peking is too close to Ulan Bator and Chinese look too much
like Mongols; just now he needs a total change of scene. There is a
flight a little later on to San Francisco, but San Francisco is
awkwardly placed in respect to the rest of his itinerary. And there
is a flight leaving almost immediately for Nairobi. Somehow Shadrach
had not considered going to Nairobi at all, nor any other black
African city, despite the vaguely felt ancestral ties. But
spontaneity, he tells himself, is good for the soul. Right at this
moment the idea of going to Nairobi seems oddly appealing.
Impulsively, unhesitatingly, he boards the plane. 
</P>
<P>He has not left Mongolia for two and a half years,
not since the time Genghis Mao unexpectedly decided to preside in
person over a vast and meaningless Committee congress being held at
the dilapidated old United Nations headquarters in New York. Shadrach
was not yet the Khan's personal physician then&mdash;a shrewd,
diplomatic Portuguese internist named Teixeira had that job&mdash;but
Teixeira was placidly dying of leukemia and Shadrach was being phased
in slowly as his replacement. Ostensibly Shadrach went to New York as
a mere junior medic, a spear carrier in the Khan's huge retinue, but
when Genghis Mao came down with a hypertensive attack afier
delivering a six-hour harangue from the podium of the former General
Assembly chamber, it was Shadrach who coped with the problem while
Teixeira lay doped and useless in his suite. Genghis Mao, having
subsequently invented Mangu to handle such ceremonial chores as
Committee congresses, had stayed close to Ulan Bator ever since. So
has Shadrach. But now he finds himself watching through the porthole
of a supersonic transport plane as the bleak Mongol steppe rapidly
retreats far below. In just a few hours he will be in Africa.</P>
<P>Africa! Already the telemetered signals from
Genghis Mao blur and fade as Shadrach approaches the
thousand-kilometer boundary. He still picks up data, feeble clicks
and bleats and pops out of the implant system, but as the plane
streaks south-westward it becomes harder and harder for Shadrach to
translate them into comprehensible analogues of the Chairman's bodily
processes: Genghis Mao, his kidneys and liver and pancreas, his heart
and lungs, his arteries, his intestines, have become remote, are
becoming unreal. And soon the signals are gone altogether, dropping
below the threshold and leaving Shadrach suddenly, amazingly, alone
in his own body. That crash of silence! That absence of subliminal
input! He had forgotten what it was like, not to have those steady
burbling pulses of information flowing through his consciousness, and
in the first moments after leaving telemeter range he feels almost
bereft, as if he has lost one of his major senses. Then the inner
silence begins to seem normal and he relaxes.</P>
<P>The plane is comfortable&mdash;a wide
rump-gripping cushion of a seat, plenty of leg room. Probably it is
about twenty years old; certainly it is pre-Virus War. Many
industries have disappeared since the War, and the aircraft industry
is one of them. The greatly reduced postwar population can easily
make do, given a proper maintenance program, with the planes it
inherited from the crowded, hectic world of the 1980s, when the old
industrial economy was going through its last great period of
convulsive expansion amid, paradoxically, dreadful shortages and
dislocations. Not that the War and the organ-rot have brought an end
to technological progress: in Shadrach's time fusion power has
rescued the world from its energy crisis, subterrene borers have
created an entirely new mass-transit-tunnel system for most urban
areas, communications systems have become immensely sophisticated,
the computerization of civilization has been well-nigh completed, and
so on. Progress continues. Things are different but not utterly
different. Even corporations and stock exchanges have survived. There
has not been a total break with the old days, merely because two
thirds of the former population has perished and a wholly new
quasi-dictatorial political structure has been imposed upon the
remnant. But this is a contracting society, daily diminished by the
inroads of organ-rot and oppressed by a certain sense of stagnation
and futility that the regime of Genghis Mao does not appear to know
how to dispel, and such a society does not need new jet transports
while the old ones still can fly.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><I>June I, continued</I></P>
<P><I>If the ruler of the world is schizoid, doesn't
this have serious consequences for his subjects? I think not. I've
studied history closely. Throughout all of history people have gotten
the rulers they deserved, the </I>appropriate <I>rulers. A sovereign
mirrors the spirit of his times and expresses the deepest traits of
his people&mdash;Hitler, Napoleon, Attila, Augustus, Ch'in Shih Huang
Ti</I>, <I>Genghis Khan, Robespierre: none of them accidents or
anomalies, all of them organic outgrowths of the needs of the time.
Even when a ruler imposes his will by conquest, as I have not, the
historical imperative is at work: those people </I>wanted <I>to be
conquered, </I>needed <I>to be conquered, or they would not have
fallen to him. So too now. Schizoid times demand schizoid government.
The people of the world are dying lingering deaths of organ-rot; an
antidote exists but we do not put it into widespread distribution;
the people of the world accept this situation. I define that as
madness. A mad government, then, for a mad citizenry, a government
that offers </I>promises <I>of antidotes but never delivers. Of
course there isn't</I> <I>enough of the Antidote to go around. But
there's some to spare. We do not give priority to expanding the
supply. We offer hope but no injections, and this somehow sustains
our subjects. Madness. A world that destroys itself with cloud-borne
antigens is mad; one that gives itself over to an oligarchy of
strangers is mad; fitting then that the oligarchs themselves are mad.</I></P>
<P><I>But are we? Am I? I have done more research
into the symptoms of schizophrenia this morning, consulting
Shadrach's medical library in Shadrach's absence. Here I have a text
that says that two of the most common symptoms are delusions and
hallucinations. &quot;A delusion,&quot; I am told, &quot;is a
persistently held belief, contrary to reality as it is perceived by
most people, that is not dispelled by logical arguments. Delusions in
schizophrenia often hove a grandiose or a persecutory theme: the
individual may express a belief that he is Jesus Christ or that he is
the object of a worldwide search by a supersecret organization.&rdquo;
</I>
</P>
<P><I>I have never expressed the belief that I am
Jesus Christ. I do frequently believe with great conviction that I am
Genghis II Mao IV Khan. Is this belief delusive? I believe that this
belief is congruent with reality as it is perceived by most people. I
believe that my belief in this belief is founded in reality. I
believe I genuinely am Genghis II Mao IV Khan, or that at least I
have genuinely become Genghis II Mao IV Khan, and that therefore this
belief is not schizophrenic, not delusive. On the other hand, I also
believe I am in imminent danger of assassination, that there is a
worldwide conspiracy against my life. Classic schizoid delusion? But
Mangu is really dead. They pushed Mangu from a window seventy-five
stories above the ground. Do I imagine Mangu's death? Mangu is really
dead. Do I misconstrue it? I know there are those who believe he
committed suicide. This is delusive. Mangu was murdered. They might
come for me at any time. Despite all my precautions. Am I deluded?
Then I accept my delusions. As appropriate to my position in history.
And if the danger is real, how wise of me to have barricaded myself
behind the interfaces!</I></P>
<P><I>Let us go on. Hallucinations. &quot;A
hallucination is a perception of sight, sound, smell, or touch that
is not 'real.' In schizophrenia, hallucinations most frequently take
the form of voices.&quot; Aha!' &ldquo;A patient may be tormented by
voices ordering him to jump out of a window or accusing him of
heinous crimes.&quot; What's this about windows? Could Mangu have
been schizoid too? No. No. It doesn't apply. Mangu wasn't intelligent
enough to be schizoid. I'm the one who hears voices, and my voices
don't advise lunacy. &quot;Sometimes the hallucination consists only
of noises or isolated words, or the patient may seem to 'hear his
thoughts.' Other hallucinations include frightening visions, strange
smells, and odd bodily sensations. &quot;</I></P>
<P><I>I think this applies. If so, I accept it
freely. But there's more. &quot;Delusions and hallucinations are not
limited to schizophrenia,&quot; it says. &quot;They may occur in a
wide range of organic conditions (e.g., infections of the brain
substance or a decreased flow of blood to the brain caused by
arteriosclerosis).'' Is that the explanation? When Father Genghis
whispers to me, it's nothing but a bug in my cerebellum ? When Mao
whispers in my ear, it's merely a clotted artery? I should speak to
Shadrach about this when he returns. He worries about my arteries. He
might want to do another transplant. After all, I still have some of
my own original blood vessels, and they're getting old. I'm, what,
eighty-seven years old? Eighty-nine, ninety-three? Yes, perhaps
ninety-three. So hard to keep the numbers straight. But old, very
old. Great Father Genghis, am I old!</I></P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>In Nairobi the air is clear, dry, cool, not at all
tropical although the city is only a degree or so from the equator,
just about the same latitude, indeed, as fiery Cotopaxi and ravaged
Quito. Quito, high in mountainous country, was cool also, but that
was only a dream, a transtemporal illusion. Whereas Shadrach actually
is, so far as anything is actual, in Nairobi. &quot;We are much above
sea level,&quot; explains the taxi driver. &quot;It is never too hot
here.&quot; The taxi man is hearty, outgoing, talkative: a Kikuyu. he
says, this being his tribe. He wears huge dark sunglasses and a blue
uniform that looks fifty years old. He seems healthy, although
Shadrach had been half expecting to find everyone outside Ulan Bator
afflicted with organ-rot. &quot;I speak six languages,&quot; the
driver announces. &quot;Kikuyu, Masai, Swahili, German, French,
English. You are British from England?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;American,&quot; Shadrach says, though the
label sounds odd in his ears. What else is he to answer, though?
Mongol?</P>
<P>&quot;American? Ah! New York? Los Angeles? Once we
had plenty Americans here. Before the big death, you know? That plane
they come in, it was big, too big, it was always full, all those
Americans! They come to see the animals, you know? Out in the bush.
With cameras. Not any more. Long time, no Americans here. No anybody
here.&quot; He laughs. &quot;Different times, now. Too bad, these
times. Except for the animals. Good  times for the animals. You see,
there, by the road? Hyena. Right by the road!&quot;</P>
<P>Yes, Shadrach sees: a lumpy, sinister beast, like
a small ungainly bear, squatting at the edge of the highway. The
driver tells him that there are wild animals everywhere now,
ostriches strutting down Nairobi's main streets, lions and cheetahs
preying on the suburban farmers, gazelles moving in huge fluttery
herds across the university campus. &quot;Because there are not
enough people now,&quot; he says. &quot;And most of them too sick.
Not much hunting now. Last week, big elephant, ripped up thorn tree
in front of New Stanley Hotel. Very old thorn tree, very famous. Very
big elephant.&quot; Of course. With the world's population cut back
now to early nineteenth-century levels, the animals would be starting
to reclaim their domain. The Virus War had left them unscathed, even
the primates closest to man: only the unlucky human chromosomes could
harbor the rot.</P>
<P>On the way to the city he sees more animals, two
stunning zebras, some wart-hogs, and a group of heavy-humped
spindle-shanked antelopes; these are wildebeests, the driver informs
him. It pleases Shadrach to observe this resurgence of nature, but
the pleasure is tainted by sadness, for if wildebeests graze on the
margins of great highways and grass grows in city streets, it is
because the time of man is coming to its end, and Shadrach is not
ready for that.</P>
<P>Actually not much grass is growing in the streets
of Nairobi, at least not on the broad, elegant boulevard on which the
taxi enters town. Flowering shrubs erupt in beauty on all sides.
After monochromatic Ulan Bator, Nairobi is a visual delight.
Bougainvillea, red and purple and orange, cascades over every wall;
some creeping succulent with densely packed lavender blossoms carpets
the islands in the roadway; thick, many-tentacled aloe trees stand
like sentinels at street corners; he recognizes hibiscus and
jacaranda, but most of the bushes and trees that fill the streets
with such gaudy masses of color are unknown to him. The effect is gay
and sparkling and unexpectedly moving: who could feel despair, he
wonders, in a world that offers such intensity of beauty? But in that
moment of transcendent joy that the glowing flowers of neatly
manicured Nairobi create comes its own instant negation, for Shadrach
asks himself also how, having been turned loose in this beautiful
world, we could  have contrived to make such a woeful mess out of so
much of it. Nevertheless this serendipitous city inspires more
pleasure than gloom in him.</P>
<P>Through flowery sun-loved Nairobi rides Shadrach
Mordecai in an old rump-sprung taxi to his hotel, the Hilton, an
aging cavernous place where he may well be the only guest. The hotel
staff treats him with extraordinary deference, as though he is some
visiting prince. In a way he is, to these people. They know he lives
at the capital and travels on a PRC passport; probably they conclude
from that that he must sit at the right hand of Genghis Mao, which in
truth he does, though he is not a part of the government at all. Yet
even those who have not seen his passport regard him with awe, here.
They pause at their work in corridors, and turn and look. They
whisper among themselves. They nod, they point, Shadrach is reminded
again of what he tends often to forget: that he is a man of great
presence and dignity, capable and self-assured and of striking
physical appearance, who radiates an aura that leads others to defer
to him. It is hard, living in the shadow of Genghis Mao, to remember
that one is a person oneself, even a considerable person, and not
merely an extension of the Chairman. In Nairobi he learns it.</P>
<P>Strolling about the city half an hour after
checking in, he makes another discovery of the obvious: everyone here
is black. Almost everyone, at any rate. He notices a few Chinese
shopkeepers, a couple of Indians, a few elderly whites, but they are
exceptions, and they stand out as clearly as he does in Ulan Bator.
Why should the negritude here surprise him? This is Africa; this is
where people are black. And it was the same, really, when he was a
boy in Philadelphia&mdash;whites rarely ventured into his
neighborhood, and at least in early childhood it was easy for him to
assume that the ghetto was the world, that black was the norm, that
those occasional creatures with pink faces and blue eyes and loose,
lank hair were freakish rarities, like the giraffes in his picture
book. But this is no ghetto. It is a nation, a universe, where the
policemen and the schoolteachers and the Committee delegates and the
firemen are black, the engineers at the fusion plant are black, the
brain surgeons and the optometrists are black, black through and
through. Brothers and sisters everywhere, and yet he is apart from
them, he feels not kinship but surprise at the universality of the
blackness. Possibly he has lived in Mongolia too long. Living in that
polyglot multiracial amalgam that surrounds Genghis Mao, he has lost
some degree of his own racial identity; and, living amid millions of
Mongols, he has developed some heightened sense of himself as
outsider, as freak, that leaves him alienated even among his own
kind. If these people, speakers of Swahili, intimates of ostrich and
cheetah, bloodlines undiluted by slavemaster genes, can be said to be
his own kind.</P>
<P>He discovers yet another obviousness: that Nairobi
is not just beautiful boulevards and clear vibrant air, not just
bowers of bougainvillea and hibiscus. This place is, however lovely
it may be, still very much a part of the Trauma Ward, and he does not
need to walk far from the precincts of his hotel to find the
sufferers. They straggle through the streets, scores of them, in all
phases of the disease, some merely pallid and sluggish, showing the
first bafflement at the onrushing crumbling of their bodies, and some
bowed and shrunken and dazed, some already hemorrhaging, dizzy with
pain and flecked with the shiny sweat of imminent death. Those in the
late stages travel in solitary orbits, each shambling alone through
the streets, God knows why, struggling with incomprehensible
determination to reach some unattainable destination before the final
breakdown overtakes them. Often the organ-rot victims pause and stare
at Shadrach, as if they know he is immune and want from him some gift
of strength, some charismatic infusion that will clothe them in the
same immunity, that will heal their lesions and make their bodies
whole. But there is nothing particularly reproachful or envious in
their gaze: it is the calm, steady, equable look that one sometimes
gets from grazing cattle, unreadable but not threatening, with no
hint in it that they hold you guilty of the slaughterhouse.</P>
<P>At first Shadrach cannot meet that level stare. He
was taught, long ago, that a doctor must be able to look at a patient
without feeling apologetic for his own good health, but this is a
different case. They are not his patients, and he is healthy only
because his political connections give him access to protection they
cannot have. He is curious about organ-rot&mdash;it is the great
medical phenomenon of the age, the latter-day Black Death, the most
terrible plague in history, and he studies its effects wherever he
encounters them&mdash;but neither his curiosity nor his medical
detachment is enough lo let him look straight at these people. He
gives them only darting sidewise glances until he realizes that his
feelings of guilt are irrelevant. These lurching wrecks don't care if
he looks at them. They are beyond caring about anything. They are
dying, right out here in public; their bellies are ablaze, their
minds are fogged; what does it matter <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">to</SPAN><I>
</I>them if some stranger stares? They look at him; he looks at them.
Invisible barriers screen him from them.</P>
<P>Then the barriers are breached. Shadrach turns
away momentarily from the procession of the damned to investigate the
window of a curio shop&mdash;grotesque wood carvings, zebra-skin
drums, elephant's-foot ashtrays, Masai spears and shields, all manner
of native artifacts mass-produced for the tourists who no longer
come&mdash;and someone gives his elbow a sharp stinging blow. He
whirls, instantly on guard. The only person at all near him is a
small withered old man, chalky-skinned, rag-clad, white-haired,
fleshless, who is moving back and forth in front of him in an erratic
semicircle, making little harsh clicking noises deep in his throat.</P>
<P>A terminal case. Eyes blotched and dim, belly
distended. The disease eats slowly through epithelial tissue,
indiscriminately ulcerating any flesh in its path; the lucky ones are
those whose vital organs are pierced quickly, but only a few are
lucky. Eighteen years have passed since the Virus War launched the
organ-rot upon mankind; Shadrach has read that many who were infected
in the first onslaught are still waiting for the end <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">to</SPAN><I>
</I>come. This man looks like one of those eighteen-year cases, but
he can't have long to wait now. Every interior mechanism must be
seared and corroded; he must be nothing but a mass of holes held
together by frail ropes of living fabric, and the next erosion,
wherever it strikes, will surely be fatal.</P>
<P>He seems to want Shadrach's attention, but he is
unable to come to a halt in the proper place. Like a robot with rusty
contacts he keeps overshooting, going by Shadrach in jerky convulsive
motions, stopping, clashing internal gears, pivoting with a wild
flapping of slack dangling arms, coming back for another try. At last
on one desperate pass he succeeds in clapping his hand around
Shadrach's forearm and anchors himself that way, standing close by
him, leaning on him, rocking gently in place.</P>
<P>Shadrach does not pull away. If he can do no more
for this maimed creature than give him support, he will at least do
that.</P>
<P>In a terrible apocalyptic caw of a voice, a sort
of whispered shriek, the old man says something to him that appears
to be of high importance.</P>
<P>&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; Shadrach murmurs. &quot;I
can't understand you.&quot;</P>
<P>The old man leans closer, straining to reach his
face up to Shadrach's, and repeats his words with even greater
urgency.</P>
<P>&quot;But I don't speak Swahili,&quot; Shadrach
says sadly. &quot;Is that Swahili? I don't understand.&quot;</P>
<P>The old man searches for a word, wrinkled lips
moving, throat bobbing, face taut with concentration. There is a
sweet, dry odor about him, the odor of faded lilies. A lesion in one
cheek seems nearly to go completely through the flesh from inside to
out; probably he could thrust the tip of his tongue through it.</P>
<P>&quot;Dead,&quot; the old man says finally, in
English, delivering the word like a monstrous weight that he drops ai
Shadrach's feet.</P>
<P>&quot;Dead?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Dead. You&mdash;make&mdash;me&mdash;dead&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>The words fall one after another from the ravaged
throat without expression, without inflection, without emphasis. <I>You.
Make. Me. Dead. </I>Is he accusing me of having given him the
disease, Shadrach wonders, or is he asking for euthanasia?</P>
<P>&quot;Dead! You! Make! Me! Dead!&quot; Then more
Swahili. Then some strained rheumy coughs. Then tears, amazingly
copious, flooding in deep channels down the dusty cheeks. The hand
that grips Shadrach's forearm tightens with sudden incredible
strength, crushing bone against bone and wringing a sharp yelp of
pain from him. Then the unexpected pressure is withdrawn; the old man
stands free for a moment, tottering; from him comes a hoarse clucking
noise, an unmistakable death rattle, and life leaves him so instantly
and completely that Shadrach has a quasi-hallucinatory vision of a
skull and bones within the old man's tattered clothes. As the body
falls Shadrach catches it and eases it to the pavement. It weighs no
more than forty kilos, he guesses.</P>
<P>What now? Notify the authorities? Which
authorities? Shadrach looks about for a Citpol, but the street, busy
a few minutes ago, is mysteriously empty. He feels responsible for
the body. 
</P>
<P>He can't simply abandon it where it dropped. He
enters the curio shop to find a telephone.</P>
<P>The proprietor is a sleek, plump Indian, sixty
years old or so, with large liquid eyes and thick dark silver-flecked
hair. He wears an old-fashioned business suit and looks dapper and
prosperous. Evidently he has witnessed the little curbside drama, for
he bustles forward now, palms pressed together, lips clamped in a
fussy oh-dear expression.</P>
<P>&quot;How regrettable!&quot; he declares. &quot;That
you should be troubled in this way! They have no decency, they have
no sense of&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It was no trouble,&quot; Shadrach says
quietly. &quot;The man was dying. He didn't have time to think about
decency.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Even so. To importune a stranger, a visitor
to our&mdash;&quot; 
</P>
<P>Shadrach shakes his head. &quot;It's all right.
Whatever he wanted from me, I couldn't provide it, and now he's dead.
I wish I could have helped. I'm a doctor,&quot; he confides, hoping
the disclosure will have the right effect.</P>
<P>It does. &quot;Ah!&quot; the shopkeeper cries.
&quot;Then you understand these things.&quot; The sensibilities of
doctors are not like those of ordinary beings. It no longer
embarrasses the proprietor that one of his shabby countrymen has had
the poor taste to inflict his death on a tourist.</P>
<P>&quot;What shall we do about the body?&quot;
Shadrach asks. 
</P>
<P>&quot;The Citpols will come. Word gets around.&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;I thought we might telephone someone&mdash;&quot;
</P>
<P>A shrug. &quot;The Citpols will come. There is no
importance. The disease is not contagious, I understand. That is, we
are all infected from the days of the War, but we have nothing to
fear from those who display actual symptoms. Or from their bodies. Is
this not true?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It's true, yes,&quot; Shadrach says. He
glances uncomfortably at the small sprawled corpse, lying like a
discarded blanket on the sidewalk outside the store. &ldquo;Perhaps
we ought to phone anyway, though.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The Citpols will come shortly,'' the
shopkeeper says again, as if dismissing the subject. &quot;Will you
have tea with me? I rarely have the opportunity to entertain a
visitor. I am Bhishma Das. You are American?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I was born there, yes. I live abroad now.&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;Ah.&quot;</P>
<P>Das busies himself behind the counter, where he
has a hotplate and some packets of tea. His indifference to the body
on the street continues to distress Shadrach; but Das does not seem
to be an unintelligent or insensitive man. Perhaps it is the custom,
out here in the Trauma Ward, to pay as little attention as possible
to these reminders of the universal mortality.</P>
<P>In any event Das is right: the Citpols do indeed
arrive swiftly, three black-skinned men in the standard uniforms,
riding in a long somber hearselike vehicle. Two of them load the body
into the car; the third peers through the shop window, staring long
and intently at Shadraeh and nodding to himself in an unfathomable,
oddly disturbing way. The Citpols finally drive away.</P>
<P>Das says, &quot;We will all die of the organ-rot
sooner or later, is this not true? We and our children as well? We
are all infected, they say. Is this not true?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;True, yes,&quot; Shadrach replies. Even he
carries the killer DNA enmeshed in his genes. Even Genghis Mao. &quot;Of
course, there's the Antidote&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The antidote. Ah. Do you believe there is
indeed an antidote?&quot;</P>
<P>Shadrach blinks. &quot;You doubt it?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I have no certain knowledge of these things.
The Chairman says there is an antidote, and that it will soon be
given to the people. But the people continue to die. Ah, the tea is
ready! Is there, then, an antidote? I have no idea. I am not sure
what to believe.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There is an antidote,&quot; says Shadrach,
accepting a delicate porcelain cup from the merchant. &quot;Yes,
truly there is. And one day it will be given to all the people.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You know this to be fact?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I know it, yes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You are a doctor. You would know.&quot;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah,&quot; Bhishma Das says, and sips his
tea. After a long pause he says, &quot;Of course, many of us will die
of the rot before the antidote is given. Not only those who lived in
the days of the War, but even our children. How can this be? I have
never understood this. My health is excellent, my sons are strong&mdash;and
yet we carry the plague within us too? It sleeps within us, waiting
its moment? It sleeps within everyone?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Everyone,&quot; Shadrach says. How can he
explain? If he talks of the structural similarities between the
organ-rot virus and the normal human genetic material, if he
describes how the virus liberated during the long-ago war was capable
of integrating itself into the nucleic acid, into the germ plasm
itself, becoming so intimately entwined with the human genetic
machinery that it is passed from generation to generation with normal
cellular genes, a deadly packet of DNA that can turn lethal at any
time, how much of this will Bhishma Das comprehend? Can Shadrach
speak of the inextricability of the lethal genetic material, the
inexorable way in which it must be incorporated into the genetic
endowment of any child conceived since the Virus War, and get the
meaning across? The intrusive organ-rot gene has become as intimate a
part of the human heritage as the gene that puts hair on the scalp or
the one that puts calcium in the bones: our tissues now are
automatically programmed at birth to deteriorate and slough off when
some unknown inner signal is given. But to Bhishma Das this may be as
baffling as the dreams of Brahma. Shadrach says at last, after a
moment's pause, &quot;Everyone who was alive when they turned the
virus loose absorbed it into his body, into the part of his body that
determines what he transmits to his children. It can't be eradicated
once it enters that part. And so we pass the virus along to our sons
and daughters the way we do the color of our skins, the color of our
eyes, the texture of our hair&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;A dreadful legacy. How sad. And the
antidote, Doctor? Would the antidote free us from this legacy?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The antidote they have now,&quot; Shadrach
says, &quot;keeps the virus from having a harmful effect on the body.
It neutralizes it, stabilizes it, holds it in a state of latency. You
follow me?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, yes, I understand. In the deep freeze!&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;So to speak. Those who receive the antidote
have to take a new dose every six months, at present. To hold the
virus in check, to keep the organ-rot from breaking out in them.&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;More tea, Doctor?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Please.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You have received this antidote yourself?&quot;
</P>
<P>Shadrach replies uneasily, after a moment's
consideration. &quot;Yes. I have.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Ah. Because you are a doctor. Because we
must keep the healers alive. I understand. It seemed to me you must
have the antidote. There is something about you; you are like a man
apart from us. You do not wake up every day wondering if this is the
day when the rot will start in you. Ah. And someday we will have the
antidote too.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes. Someday. The government is working on
increasing the supply.&quot; The lie sours his mouth. &quot;I wish
you could have your first injection today.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It is not important for me,&quot; Das says
calmly. &quot;I am old and I have enjoyed good health, and my life
has been a happy one even in the most troubled times. If the rot
begins in me tomorrow, I will be ready for it. But my sons, and the
sons of my sons, I would spare them. What do old wars mean to them?
Why should they die horrible deaths for the sake of nations that were
forgotten before they were born? I want them to live. My family has
been in Kenya for a hundred fifty years, since we first came from
Bombay, and we have been happy here, and why should we perish now?
Sad, Doctor, sad. This curse on mankind. Will we ever cleanse
ourselves of what we have done to ourselves?&quot;</P>
<P>Shadrach shrugs. There is no way to comb the
murderous new gene out of the genetic package; but in theory a
permanent antidote is possible, a hybrid DNA that can be integrated
into the contaminated genes to absorb or detoxify the lethal genetic
material. Somewhere in the PRC organization they are at work on such
an antidote, Shadrach has been told. Of course, the rumor may be
false. The research group may be only a myth. The permanent antidote
itself may be only a myth.</P>
<P>He says, &quot;I think these last twenty years
have been a purge that mankind necessarily had to undergo. A
punishment for accumulated idiocies and foolishnesses, perhaps. The
whole history of the twentieth century is like an arrow pointing
straight to the Virus War and its aftermath. But I believe we'll
survive the ordeal.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And things will be again as they once were?&quot;
</P>
<P>Shadrach smiles. &quot;I hope not. If we go back
to where we were, we'll only arrive again eventually at the same
place we've reached now. And we may not survive the next version of
the Virus War. No, I think we'll build a better world out of the
ruins, a quieter, less greedy world. It'll take time. I'm not sure
how we're going to accomplish it. Many bad things will happen first.
Millions will die needless, horrible deaths. But eventually&mdash;
eventually&mdash;the suffering will be over, the dying will be done,
and those who remain will live in happiness again,&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;How refreshing to hear such optimism.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Am I an optimist? I've never thought of
myself that way. A realist, maybe. But not an optimist. How strange
suddenly to find myself an apostle of faith and good cheer!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Your eyes were glowing when you said what
you said. You were already living in that better world as you spoke.
Do you want to withdraw your prophecy? Please, no. You believe that
that happier world will come.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I hope it'll come,&quot; Shadrach says
soberly. 
</P>
<P>&quot;You know it will.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I'm not sure. Perhaps I sounded sure a
moment ago, but&mdash;&quot; He shakes his head. He makes a
determined effort to recapture that unexpected strain of positive
thinking that had come so surprisingly from him a moment ago. &quot;Yes,&quot;
he says. &quot;Things <I>will </I>gel better.&quot; Already there is
something forced about it, but he goes on. &quot; No trend continues
downward forever. The organ-rot can be defeated. The smaller
population that exists now will be able to live comfortably in a
world that couldn't support the numbers of people who lived before
the War. Yes. A purge, an ordeal by fire, a necessary corrective to
old abuses, leading to better things. Dawn after the long darkness.&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;Ah. You <I>are </I>an optimist!&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Perhaps I am. Sometimes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I would like to see a man like you as the
leader of that new world,&quot; Bhishma Das exclaims rapturously.</P>
<P>Shadrach recoils. &quot;No, not me. Let me live in
that world, yes. But don't ask me to govern it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You will change your mind when the moment
comes. They will offer you the government, Doctor, because you are
wise and good, and you will accept. Because you are wise and good.&quot;
Das pours more tea. His naive faith is touching. Shadrach takes a
sip; then he has a sudden morbid vision of Bhishma Das, a year or iwo
from now, crying out in surprise and delight as the new Chairman of
the Permanent Revolutionary Committee appears for the first time on
his television screen, and the face of the new Chairman is the finely
wrought brown-skinned face of that wise and good American doctor who
once visited his store. Shadrach coughs and sputters and nearly
spills his cup. The face will be the face of Dr. Mordecai, yes, but
the mind behind the warm searching eyes will be the cold dark mind of
Genghis Mao. 
</P>
<P>Shadrach has almost managed to forget Project
Avatar, this day in Nairobi. Almost.</P>
<P>&quot;I should be going,&quot; Shadrach says.
&quot;It's late in the day. You'll want to close the shop.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Stay awhile. There is no hurry.&quot; Then:
&quot;I invite you to my home for dinner this evening.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I'm afraid I can't&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Another engagement? Oh, how regrettable. We
would provide a fine curry in your honor. We would open a fine wine.
Some close friends&mdash;the most stimulating members of the Hindu
community, professional people, teachers, philosophers&mdash;intelligent
conversation&mdash;ah, yes, yes, a delightful evening, if you would
grace our home!&quot;</P>
<P>A temptation. Shadrach will dine alone, otherwise,
at his hotel, a stranger in this strange city, lonely and in peril.
But no: impossible. One of those stimulating Hindu professional
persons will surely ask him where he lives, what kind of doctoring he
does, and either he must lie, which is repugnant to him, or he must
let it all spill out&mdash;member of privileged dictatorial elite,
physician to the terrifying Genghis Mao, etc., etc., and so much for
his new reputation as a humanitarian benefactor: the truth about him
will sicken the friends of Bhishma Das and humiliate poor Das
himself. Shadrach mumbles sincere-sounding excuses and regrets. As he
edges to the door, Das follows him, saying, &quot;At least accept a
gift from me, a remembrance of this charming hour.&quot; The merchant
glances hastily about his shelves, searching among the spears, the
beaded necklaces, the wooden statuettes, everything apparently too
crude, too flimsy, too inexpensive, or too awkwardly large to make a
fitting offering for such a distinguished guest, and it seems for an
instant that Shadrach will get out of the place ungifted; but at the
last moment Das snatches up a small antelope horn in which a hole has
been drilled at the pointed end and plugged with wax. A cupping horn,
Das explains, used by a tribe near the southern border to draw pain
and evil spirits from the bodies of the sick: one applies the cup to
the skin, sucks, creates a vacuum, seals it with the wax plug. He
urges it on Shadrach, saying it is an appropriate gift for a healer,
and Shadrach, after a conventional show of reluctance, accepts
gladly. He has no East African medical devices in his collection.
&quot;They still use these,&quot; Das informs him. &quot;They use
them very much just now, to draw forth the organ-rot spirit.&quot; He
bows Shadrach from the store, telling him again and again what an
honor his visit has been, what pleasure has come from hearing the
doctor's words of hope.</P>
<P>On the seven-block journey back to the hotel
Shadrach counts four dead bodies in the streets, and one that is not
quite dead, but will be soon. &quot;</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3><I>21</I></H3>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>In the morning he flies onward, toward Jerusalem.
He is aware of the curve of the planet below him, the enormous belly
of the world, and he is amazed anew by its complexity, its richness,
this globe that holds Athens and Samarkand, Lhasa and Rangoon,
Timbuktu, Benares, Chartres, Ghent, all the fascinating works of
vanishing mankind, and all the natural wonders, the Grand Canyon, the
Amazon, the Himalayas, the Sahara&mdash;so much, so much, for one
small cosmic lump, such variety, such magnificent multitudinousness.
And it is all his, for whatever time remains before Genghis Mao calls
upon him to yield up the world and go.</P>
<P>He is not, like Bhishma Das, ready to go whenever
his marching orders arrive. The world, now that he is again out in
the midst of it, seems very beautiful, and he has seen so little of
it. There are mountains to climb, rivers to cross, wines to taste. He
who has been spared from organ-rot does not want to succumb to
another man's lust for immortality. Shadrach's passivity has fallen
from him: he does not accept the fate in store for him. Bhishma Das
called him an optimist, a wise and good man whose face glows when he
speaks of the better days that are coming, and though that was not
how Shadrach had ever seen himself, he is pleased that Das saw him
that way, pleased that those unexpectedly hopeful words tumbled from
his lips. It is agreeable to be thought of as a man of sunny spirit,
to be a source of hope and faith. He tries the image on and likes the
fit. It is a little like smiling when one is not in a smiling mood,
and feeling the smile work its way inward from the facial muscles to
the soul: why <I>not </I>smile, why <I>not </I>live in the hope of a
glorious resurrection? It costs nothing. It makes others happier. If
one is proven wrong, as no doubt one will be, one has at least had
the reward of having dwelled for a time in a warm little sphere of
inner light rather than in dank dark despair.</P>
<P>But it is hard to put much conviction into one's
optimism when the threat of immediate doom hangs over one. I must
deal somehow with the problem of Project Avatar, Shadrach resolves.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><I>December 8, 2001</I></P>
<P><I>So I am not to suffer the organ-rot after all.
Today I had my first dose of Roncevic's drug. They say that if your
smears have shown no trace of the virus in its active state before
your first injection, you are safe, but the antidote can do nothing
for you if the thing has already entered into the lethal phase. My
smears were clean: I am safe. I never doubted that I would be spared.
I was not meant to perish in the Virus War, but rather to endure, to
survive the general holocaust and enter into my own true time. Which
now has come. ''You will live a hundred years,&rdquo; Roncevic said
to me this morning. Does he mean a hundred more years? Or a hundred
all told? In which case I have only about twenty-five years left. Not
enough, not enough.</I></P>
<P><I>No matter what, I'll outlive poor Roncevic. He
has the rot already. It glistens and blazes in his belly. How hard he
worked to develop his drug, how eager he was to save himself! But not
in time. The disease went active in him too soon, and he will go. He
goes, I stay: he plays his appointed role in the drama and leaves the
stage. While I live on, perhaps another hundred years. My physical
vitality has always been extraordinary. No doubt my bodily energies
are of superior order, for here I am, past seventy, with the vigor of
a young man. Resisting disease, deflecting fatigue. They say that
Chairman Mao, when he was past seventy, swam eight miles in the
Yangtze in an hour and five minutes. Swimming is of no interest to
me; yet I know that if there were need, I could swim ten miles in
those sixty-five minutes; I could swim twenty.</I></P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Jerusalem is colder than Shadrach expects&mdash;almost
as chilly as Ulan Bator on this late spring morning&mdash;and
smaller, too, amazingly compact for a place where so much history has
been made. He settles in at the International, a sprawling old
mid-twentieth-century hotel stunningly located high on the Mount of
Olives. From his balcony he has a superb view of the old walled city.
Awe and excitement rise in him as he looks out upon it. Those two
great glittering domes down there&mdash;his map tells him the huge
gold one is the Dome of the Rock, on the site of Solomon's Temple,
and the silver one is the Aqsa Mosque&mdash;and that formidable
battlemented wall, and the ancient stone towers, and the tangle of
winding streets, all speak to him of human endurance, of the slow
steady tides of history, the arrivals and departures of monarchs and
empires. The city of Abraham and Isaac, of David and Solomon, the
city Nebuchadnezzar destroyed and Nehemiah rebuilt, the city of the
Maccabees, of Herod, the city where Jesus suffered and died and rose
from the dead, the city where Mohammed, in a vision, ascended into
heaven, the city of the Crusaders, the city of legend, of fantasy, of
pilgrimages, of conquests, of layer upon layer of event, layers
deeper and more intricate than those of Troy&mdash;that little city
of low buildings of tawny stone just across the swooping valley from
him counsels him that apocalyptic hours are followed by rebirth and
reconstruction, that no disaster is eternal. The mood that came upon
him when he was with Bhishma Das has survived the journey out of
Africa. Jerusalem is truly a city of light, a city of joy. He
remembers his hymn-singing great-aunts Ellie and Hattie clapping
their hands and chanting&mdash;</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Jerusalem, my happy home 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When shall I come to thee? 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When shall my sorrows have an end? 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Thy joys when shall I see?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>&mdash;and suddenly he is again a boy of six or
seven, wearing tight blue trousers and a starched white shirt,
standing between those two colossal black women in their Sunday
finery, singing with them, clapping his hands, humming or making up
words where he does not know the right ones, oh, yes, Jerusalem,
Jerusalem, lead me unto Jerusalem, Lord! That promised land, long
ago, far away, that city of prophets and kings, Jerusalem the golden,
with milk and honey blest, and here he is at its gates, trembling
with anticipation. He calls for a cab.</P>
<P>But when he actually enters the city, passing
through St. Stephen's Gate and stepping forth onto the Via Dolorosa,
that romance and fantasy begins unexpectedly to evaporate, and he
wonders how he could have babbled so blithely to Das of the good
times a-coming. Jerusalem is undeniably picturesque, yes&mdash;but to
call a place picturesque is to damn it&mdash;with its narrow steep
streets and sturdy age-old masonry, its crowded stalls piled high
with pots and pans, fish and apples, pastries and flayed lambs, its
scents of strange spices, its hawk-faced old men in Bedouin regalia,
but a cold wind whistles through the filthy alleyways and everyone he
sees, children and beggars and merchants and shoppers and porters and
workmen alike, has that same look of dull despair, that same
hollow-eyed broken-souled expression that is the mark not of
endurance but of anticipated defeat and surrender: <I>The Assyrians
are coming, the Romans are coining, the Persians are coming, the
Saracens are coming, the Turks are coming, the organ-rot is coming,
and we will be crushed, we will be everlastingly annihilated.</I></P>
<P>It is impossible to escape the twenty-first
century even within these medieval walls. Climbing toward Golgotha,
Shadrach sees the standard mourning poster of Mangu pasted up all
over, the bland young face against the brilliant yellow background.
Mangu's presence was not absent from Nairobi, naturally, but in that
spacious and airy city the posters were less oppressive, easily
obscured by the dazzle of the bougainvilleas and the jacarandas. Here
the heavy stone walls sweat garish images of Mangu over passageways
barely wide enough for three to go abreast, yellow blotches
impossible to escape, and, seeing them, one feels the malign hand of
Genghis Mao passing over the city, imposing on it an unfelt grief for
the dead viceroy. Genghis Mao is more immediately present, too, the
familiar sinister leathery features glowering from breeze-bellied
banners at every major intersection. The natives take these alien
images as casually as, no doubt, they once took the posters and
banners of Nebuchadnezzar, Ptolemy, Titus, Chosroes, Saladin,
Suleiman the Magnificent, and all the other transient intruders, but
to Shadrach these reduplicated Mongol faces loll against his
consciousness like so many leaden bells counting out his dwindling
hours.</P>
<P>Then too the organ-rot is here. Not as
conspicuously as in Nairobi, perhaps, for on the broad avenues of
that city the terminal cases walked alone, stumbling and lurching
through private zones of vacant space. Old <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">Jerusalem</SPAN><I>
</I>is too <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">congested</SPAN><I> </I>for
that. But there is no scarcity of victims, shivering and sweating and
groping along the Via Dolorosa. Occasionally one halts, sags against
a wall, digs his fingers between the stones for support. The Stations
of the Cross are indicated by marble plaques set into walls: here
Jesus received the cross, here He fell the first time, here He
encountered His Mother, and so on. And here, <I>up </I>the Via
Dolorosa, go the dying, lost in their own crucifixions. As in
Nairobi, they stare without seeming to see. But a few stretch their
hands toward him as if imploring his blessing. This is a town where
miracles have not been uncommon, and the black stranger is a man of
dignity <I>and </I>stature: who knows, perhaps a new Savior walks
these streets? But Shadrach has no miracles to offer, none. He is
helpless. He is as much a dead man as they are, though he still walks
about. As they do.</P>
<P>He feels much too conspicuous, too tall, too
black, too alien, too healthy. Beggars, mostly children, cluster
about him like flies. <I>&quot;Dol-lar,&quot; </I>they implore.
<I>&quot;Dol-lar, dol-lar, dol-lar!&quot; </I>He carries no coins&mdash;he
uses a government credit planchet to cover all expenses&mdash;and so
there is no way he can get rid of them. He scoops one five-year-old
into the air, hoping to make a piggyback ride serve in lieu of
baksheesh, but the expression of terror in the child's huge eyes is
so pitiful that Shadrach quickly puts him down, and kneels, trying to
give comfort. The child's fright passes at once: <I>&quot;Dol-lar,&quot;
</I>he demands. Shadrach shrugs and the child spits at him and runs.
There are too many children here, too many everywhere, unattended,
running in packs through the cities of the world. They are orphans,
running wild, a feral generation. Shadrach has seen Donna Labile's
demographic surveys: the worst impact of the organ-rot has fallen
upon those who would now be between the ages of twenty-five and
forty, Shadrach's own contemporaries, those who were children during
the Virus War. Slower to succumb than their parents were, they
survived into adulthood&mdash;just long enough, most of them, to
marry and bring forth young; then they died, having seeded the world
with little savages. The PRC has begun to establish camps for these
abandoned children, but they are not much more attractive than
prisons, and the system is not working well. 
</P>
<P>It is too much for Shadrach&mdash;the fierce
children, the woeful staggerers, the dirt, the unfamiliar density of
the populace that throngs this tiny walled city. There is no way to
escape the overwhelming sadness of the place. He should never have
entered it; it would have been better by far to look out from his
hotel balcony and think romantic thoughts of Solomon and Saladin. He
is pushed, prodded, pawed, and elbowed; harsh-sounding things are
said to him in languages he does not understand; he is beleaguered by
offers to buy his clothing, to sell him jewelry, to take him on tours
of the great religious sites. Without the help of guides he makes his
way to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, a grimy and graceless
building, but he does not go in, for some kind of pitched battle
seems to be under way at its main entrance between priests of
different sects, who shout and shake fists and tug one another's
beards and shred one another's cassocks. Turning aside, he finds,
just back of the church, a busy bazaar&mdash;more accurately a flea
market&mdash;where sherds and tatters of the former era are for sale:
broken radios, antique television tubes, outboard engines, a
miscellany of gears and wheels and cameras and electric shavers and
telephones and pumps and gyroscopes and vacuum cleaners and batteries
and lasers and gauges and tape recorders and calculators and
microscopes and phonographs and washing machines and prisms and
amplifiers, all the debris of the affluent twentieth century washed
up on this strange shore. Everything is seemingly broken or
defective, but the traders are doing a brisk business anyway.
Shadrach is unable even to guess what uses these remnants and
fragments may now be finding in the Palestinian hinterlands. He
actually spies something he wants for his own medical collection, a
gleaming little ultramicrotome once used to prepare tissue sections
for the electron microscope, but when he produces his credit planchet
rather than haggle, the trader merely gives him a blank, sullen
stare. The PRC has decreed that government planchets must be accepted
as legal tender everywhere, but the old Arab, after examining the
glossy strip of plastic without much interest, hands it silently back
to Shadrach and turns away. There is a Citpol at the edge of the
marketplace who appears to be watching the aborted transaction.
Shadrach could call the policeman over and get him to make the trader
honor the planchet, but he decides against it; perhaps there will be
unforeseeable complications, even dangers, and he does not want to
attract attention in this place. He abandons the microtome and walks
off to the south, through quieter streets, a residential district.</P>
<P>In a few minutes he comes to steps that lead
downward to a great opened space, a cobblestoned plaza, at the far
end of which stands an immense wall made of titanic blocks of
roughhewn stone. Shadrach ambles across the plaza, heading toward the
wall as he studies his map and tries to get his bearings. He
remembers turning left, then left again at the Street of the
Chain&mdash;perhaps he is in the old Jewish Quarter, heading back
toward the Dome of the Rock and the Aqsa, in which case&mdash; &quot;You
should cover your head in this place,&quot; says a quiet voice at his
right elbow. &quot;You stand on holy ground.&quot;</P>
<P>A small compact man, seventy years old or more,
tanned and vigorous-looking, has approached him. He wears a round
black skullcap, and, with a courteous but insistent gesture, has
produced another from his pocket which he extends toward Shadrach.</P>
<P>&quot;Isn't this whole city holy ground?&quot;
Shadrach asks, taking the skullcap.</P>
<P>&quot;Every inch is holy to someone, yes. The
Arabs have their places, the Copts, the Greek Orthodox, the
Armenians, the Syrian Christians, everyone. But this is ours. Don't
you know the Wall?&quot; There is no mistaking the capital letter in
his voice. 
</P>
<P>&quot;The Wall,&quot; Shadrach says, embarrassed,
staring at the great stone blocks, then at his map. &quot;Oh. Of
course. You mean this is the Wailing Wall? I didn't realize&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The Western Wall, we called it, after the
reconquest in 1967, when the wailing stopped for a time. Now it is
the Wailing Wall again. Though I myself do not believe much in
wailing, even in times such as these.&quot; The little man smiles.
&quot;Under whatever name, it is for us Jews a holy of holies. The
last remnant of the Temple.&quot; Again the capital letter. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Solomon's Temple?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, not that one. The Babylonians destroyed
the First Temple, twenty-seven hundred years ago. This is the wall of
the Second Temple, Herod's Temple, leveled by the Romans under Titus.
The Wall is all that the Romans left standing. We revere it because
it is for us a symbol not only of persecution but of endurance, of
survival. This is your first time in Jerusalem?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;American?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes,&quot; Shadrach says.</P>
<P>&quot;I am also. So to speak. My father brought me
here when I was seven. To a kibbutz in the Galilee. Just after the
proclamation of the State of Israel, you know?&mdash;in 1948. I
fought in the Sinai in '67, the Six Day War, and I was here to pray
at the Wall in the first days after the victory, and I have lived in
Jerusalem ever since. And the Wall to me is still the center of the
world. I come here every day. Even though there is no longer really a
State of Israel. Even though there are no longer any states at all,
any dreams, any&mdash;&quot; He pauses. &quot;Forgive me. I talk too
much. Would you like to pray at the Wall?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But I'm not Jewish,&quot; Shadrach says.</P>
<P>&quot;What does that matter? Come with me. You are
a Christian?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Not particularly.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No religion at all?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No official religion. But I would like to go
to the Wall.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Come, then.&quot; They stride across the
plaza, the short old man and the tall young one. Shadrach's companion
says suddenly, &quot;I am Meshach Yakov.&quot;</P>
<P><I>&quot;Meshach?&quot;</I></P>
<P>&quot;Yes. It is a name from the Bible, The Book
of Daniel. He was one of the three Jews who defied Nebuchadnezzar
when the king ordered them to&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I know,&quot; Shadrach cries, &quot;I know!&quot;
He is laughing. Delight bubbles in him. It is a delicious moment.
&quot;You don't have to tell me the story. I'm Shadrach!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Pardon me?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Shadrach. Shadrach Mordecai. It's my name.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Your name,&quot; says Meshach Yakov. He
laughs too. &quot;Shadrach. Shadrach Mordecai. It is a beautiful
name. It could be a fine Israeli name. With a name like that you
aren't Jewish?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The wrong genes, I think. But I suppose that
if I converted I wouldn't need to bother changing my name.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No. No. A beautiful Jewish name. <I>Shalom,
</I>Shadrach!&quot;</P>
<P><I>&quot;Shalom, </I>Meshach!&quot;</P>
<P>They laugh together. It is almost a vaudeville
routine, Shadrach thinks. That Citipol lurking over there&mdash;is he
Abednego? They are right by the Wall, now, and the laughter goes from
them. The enormous weatherbeaten blocks seem incredibly ancient, as
old as the Pyramids, as old as the Ark. Meshach Yakov closes his
eyes, leans forward, touches his forehead to the Wall as though
greeting it. Then he looks at Shadrach. &quot;How shall I pray?&quot;
Shadrach asks.</P>
<P>&quot;How? How? Pray any way you want to pray!
Speak with the Lord! Tell Him things. Ask Him things. Do I need to
tell a grown man how to pray? What can I tell you? Only this: it is
better to give thanks than to ask favors. If you can. If you can.&quot;</P>
<P>Shadrach nods. He turns toward the Wall. His mind
is empty. His soul is empty. He glances at Meshach Yakov. The
Israeli, eyes closed, is rocking gently back and forth, murmuring to
himself in what Shadrach assumes is Hebrew. No prayers come to
Shadrach's lips. He can think only of the <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">wild</SPAN><I>
</I>children, the organ-rot, the blank despondent faces along the Via
Dolorosa, the posters of Mangu and Genghis Mao. This journey of his
has been a failure. He has learned nothing, he has achieved nothing.
He might as well get himself back to Ulan Bator tomorrow and face
what must be faced. But the moment he articulates those thoughts, he
rejects them. What of that sudden upwelling of optimism as he sipped
tea with Bhishma Das? What of the moment of delight, of warm
fellow-feeling, that he experienced on first hearing Meshach Yakov's
name? These two old men, the Hindu, the Jew, both so sturdy of soul,
so patient and steady under the weight of the world catastrophe&mdash;has
nothing of their strength rubbed off on him?</P>
<P>He stands a long while, listening to the silence
within his body that is the absence of Genghis Mao's outputs, and
decides that it is not yet time to return to Ulan Bator. He will go
onward. He will complete his tour.</P>
<P>He says, under his breath, too self-conscious to
let Meshach Yakov hear it. &quot;Thank you, Lord, for having made
this world and for having let me live in it as long as I have.&quot;
<I>Better to give thanks than to ask favors. </I>Even so, asking
favors is not forbidden. To himself Shadrach adds, &quot;And let me
stay in it awhile longer, Lord. And show me how I can help make it
more like the place you meant it to be.&quot; The prayer sounds
foolish to him, mawkish, ingenuous. And yet not contemptible. And yet
not contemptible. If it were given to him to live this one moment
over, he would not revise that prayer, although he would not like to
admit to anyone, either, that he had uttered it. When they are done
at the Wall, Meshach Yakov invites Shadrach to dinner; and Shadrach,
who has come to regret having refused Bhishma Das's invitation,
accepts. Yakov lives in the modern sector of Jerusalem, far to the
west of the old city, out beyond the parliament buildings and the
university campus, in a high-rise atop a bare lofty hill. The
apartment house, one of a complex of twenty or so, has the glossy,
glassy look favored in the late twentieth century, but the marks of
decay are all over it. Windows are dusty, even broken, doors are out
of true, the balconies are splotched with rust, the elevator creaks
and groans. The place is more than half empty, Yakov tells him. As
the population dwindles and services deteriorate, people have
deserted these once-choice suburbs to live closer to the center of
town. But he has been here forty years, he says proudly, and he
intends to stay another forty, at the very least.</P>
<P>Yakov's apartment itself is small, well kept,
furnished sparsely in a tasteful, old-fashioned way. &quot;My sister
Rebekah,&quot; he says. &quot;My grandchildren, Joseph, Leah.&quot;
He tells them Shadrach's name, and they all have a hearty laugh over
the coincidence, the close biblical association. The sister is in her
seventies, Joseph about eighteen, Leah twelve or thirteen. There are
black-framed photographs on the wall&mdash;Yakov's wife, Shadrach
assumes, and three grown children, probably all victims of the
organ-rot. Yakov does not say, Shadrach does not ask.</P>
<P>&quot;Are you Jewish?&quot; Leah demands.</P>
<P>Shadrach smiles, shakes his head.</P>
<P>&quot;There are black Jews,&quot; she says. &quot;I
know. There are even Chinese Jews.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Genghis Mao is a Jew,&quot; Joseph says, and
bursts into wild laughter. But he laughs alone. Meshach Yakov glares
at him; Yakov's sister looks shocked, Leah embarrassed. Shadrach
finds himself shaken by the sudden intrusion of that alien name into
this serene self-contained household.</P>
<P>Stiffly Yakov says to the boy, &quot;Don't talk
nonsense.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I didn't mean anything,&quot; Joseph
protests.</P>
<P>&quot;Then save your breath,&quot; Yakov snaps. To
Shadrach he says, &quot;We are not great admirers of the Chairman
here. But I would not like to discuss such things. I apologize for
the boy's silliness. &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It's all right,&quot; Shadrach says.</P>
<P>Leah says, &quot;Why do you have a Jewish name?&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;My people often took first names from the
Bible,'' Shadrach tells her. &quot;My father's father was a minister,
a religious scholar. He suggested it. I have an uncle named Absalom.
Had. And cousins named Solomon and Saul.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But the last name,&quot; the girl persists.
&quot;That's what I mean. It's Jewish too. There once was a great
rabbi named Mordecai, in Germany, long ago. We heard about him in
school. Do black people pick their own last names too?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;They were given to us, by our owners. My
family must once have been owned by someone named Mordecai.&quot; 
</P>
<P><I>&quot;Owned?&quot;</I></P>
<P>&quot;When they were slaves,&quot; Joseph whispers
harshly.</P>
<P> &quot;You were slaves too?&quot; the girl says.
&quot;I didn't know. We were slaves in Egypt, you know. Thousands of
years ago.&quot;</P>
<P>Shadrach smiles. &quot;We were slaves in America.
More recently.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And your owner was a Jew? I don't believe a
Jew would own slaves, not ever.&quot;</P>
<P>Shadrach wants to explain that the slavemaster
Mordecai, if ever he existed and gave his name to his blacks, was not
necessarily Jewish, but might have been, for even Jews were not
beyond owning slaves in the days of the plantation; but the
discussion is making Meshach Yakov uncomfortable, apparently, and
with such abruptness that the children are left gaping he changes the
subject, asking his sister whether dinner will be ready soon.</P>
<P>&quot;Fifteen minutes,&quot; she says, heading for
the kitchen. As though heeding an unspoken warning to leave the guest
in peace, Joseph and Leah withdraw to a couch and begin a stilted,
awkward conversation about events in school&mdash;a worldwide holiday
has been proclaimed, it seems, for the day of Mangu's funeral, and
Joseph, who is at the university, will be deprived of a field trip to
the Dead Sea, which annoys him. Leah cites some remark made by
Jerusalem's PRC chief about the importance of paying respect to the
fallen viceroy, bringing a derisive hoot from Rebekah in the kitchen
and a brusque comment about the official's intelligence and sanity,
and soon things degenerate into a noisy, incomprehensible discussion
of local political matters, involving all four Yakovs in a fierce
bilingual shouting match. Meshach, at the outset, attempts to explain
to Shadrach something about the cast of characters and the
background, but as the dispute goes along he becomes too embroiled in
it to keep up his running commentary. Shadrach, baffled but amused,
watches these articulate and spirited people wrangle until the
arrival of dinner brings a sudden halt to the debate. He has no idea
what the battle was about&mdash;it has to do with the replacement of
a Christian Arab by a Moslem on the city council, he thinks&mdash;
but it cheers him to see such a display of energy and commitment. In
Ulan Bator, bugged and spy-eyed to an ultimate degree, he has never
witnessed such furious clashes of opinion; but perhaps the spy-eyes
have nothing to do with it, perhaps it is only because he has lived
outside the framework of the nuclear family for so long that he has
forgotten what real conversation is like.</P>
<P>The advent of dinner is worrisome&mdash;should he
don the skullcap? What other customs are there that he does not
know?&mdash;but no problems arise. Neither Meshach nor his grandson
wears a skullcap; there is no prayer before eating, only a moment of
silent grace observed by the two old people; the food is rich and
plentiful, and Shadrach does not notice any special dietary customs
in force at the Yakov table. Afterward Joseph and Leah retire to
their rooms to study, and Shadrach, warmed by red Israeli wine and
strong Israeli brandy, settles down with old Yakov to study maps of
the vicinity, for they have agreed at dinner to go on a sightseeing
tour in the morning. The old city, certainly, its towers and churches
and marketplaces, and the supposed tomb of Absalom in the Kidron
Valley nearby, and the tomb of King David on Mount Zion, and the
archaeological museum, and the national museum where yhe Dead Sea
scrolls are kept, and&mdash;</P>
<P>&quot;Wait,&quot; Shadrach says. &quot;All this in
one day?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;We'll take two, then,&quot; Meshach says.</P>
<P>&quot;Even so. Can we really cover so much ground
so fast?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Why not? You look healthy enough. I think
you can keep up with me.&quot; And the old man laughs.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3><I>22</I></H3>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>In Istanbul a few days later he has no guide, and
he wanders that intricate city of many levels alone, confused,
defeated by the complexities of getting from one place to another,
wishing that some Meshach Yakov would discover him here, some Bhishma
Das. But none does. The map he gets at his hotel is useless, for
there are few street signs, and whenever he veers off a main
boulevard he immediately gets lost in a maze of anonymous alleyways.
There are taxis, but the drivers seem to speak only Turkish, tourism
having perished during the Virus War; they can follow self-evident
instructions&mdash;&quot;Haghia Sophia&quot; &mdash;&quot;Top-kapi&quot;&mdash;but
when he wants to go <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">to</SPAN><I> </I>the
ancient Byzantine ram-pan on the outskirts of the city he is unable
to make any driver understand, and in the end he has to resort to
asking to be taken to the Kariya Mosque on the city's outskirts, and
getting from there to the nearby wall on foot, by guesswork.</P>
<P>Istanbul is gritty, grimy, archaic, alien, and
irritating. Shadrach is fascinated by its architectural mix, the
opulent Ottoman palaces and the glorious many-minareted mosques and
the eighteenth-century wooden houses and the sweeping
twentieth-century avenues and the battered fragments of old
Constantinople that jut like broken teeth from the earth, bits of
aqueducts and cisterns and basilicas and stadiums. But the city is
too chaotic for him. It depresses and repels him despite the powerful
appeal of its rich-textured history. Even now more than a million
people live here, and Shadrach finds it hard to cope with such a
density of humanity. There are the usual dismaying organ-rot
tragedies on display in the streets, and an extraordinary number of
feral children, some only three or four years old, trooping like
desperate scavengers everywhere. And there are Citpols moving in wary
pairs wherever he turns. Watching him, he is convinced. Is it just
paranoia? He doesn't think so. He thinks that Genghis Mao, unhappy
over having given his physician leave to roam the world, is keeping
him under surveillance so that he can be brought back to Ulan Bator
at the Khan's whim. Shadrach had not expected to be able to vanish
totally&mdash;indeed, returning to Ulan Bator is definitely central
to his emerging plan of action, though he still does not know when
the right moment to go back will arrive&mdash;but he does not like
the idea of being spied upon. After two days in Istanbul, a
perfunctory tour of the standard sights, he flies abruptly to Rome.</P>
<P>He spends a week there, making his headquarters in
an ancient hotel, mellow and luxurious, a few blocks from the Baths
of Diocletian. Rome too is densely populated, and its urban pace is
frenetic, but for some reason there are fewer scars of the Virus War
and its nightmare aftermath here, and Shadrach begins to relax, to
ease himself into a comfortable Mediterranean rhythm of life: he
strolls the splendid streets, he sips aperitifs at sidewalk cafes, he
gorges himself on pasta and young white wine at obscure trattorias,
and all the traumas of the Trauma Ward become insignificant. Truly
this is the Eternal City, capable of absorbing all of time's heaviest
blows and never losing its resilience. He sees, of course, the
imperial monuments, the Arch of Titus that commemorates the Roman
sacking of Jerusalem, the temples and palaces of the Capitoline and
Palatine, the magnificent jumble that is the Forum, the haunted wreck
of the Colosseum. He visits St. Peter's, and, looking up toward the
Vatican, muses on Genghis Mao's mocking, corrosive offer to make him
Pope. He does the Sistine Chapel, the Etruscan collection in the
Villa Giulia, the Borghese gallery, and a dozen of the best baroque
churches. His energies seem to grow rather than flag as he pursues
the infinite antiquities of Rome. Oddly, he finds himself responding
most intensely not to the celebrated classic monuments but to the
ancient gray tenements, steep and gaunt, in Trastevere and the Jewish
quarter. Are these the very tenements of Caesar's time, mansions
once, slums now? Is it possible that they are still inhabited after
two thousand years? Why not? The old Romans knew how to build six
stories high, and even higher, and built of durable stone. And it
would not have been hard, despite the sackings and the fires and the
revolutions, to keep those buildings intact, to rebuild, replaster,
patch the old and make it new, constantly to refurbish and restore.
So these gray towers may once have housed the subjects of Tiberius
and Caligula, and Shadrach gets a pleasant little shiver from the
thought that they have been continuously occupied across the ages. On
second thought, it probably is not so; nothing, he decides, endures
that long in daily use. These are more likely twelfth-century
buildings, fourteenth-, even seventeenth-. Old enough but not truly
ancient. Except in the sense that anything that antedates the rise of
Genghis Mao, that has survived out of that former world, that
prediluvian epoch, is ancient.</P>
<P>He wishes he could stay in Rome forever. A pity,
he thinks, that Genghis Mao wasn't serious about the papacy. But
after a week Shadrach resolves to go onward. It is too pleasant here,
too comfortable; besides, as he downs a Strega at his favorite cafe
one warm humid evening, he notices two Citpols at a table at a cafe
on the opposite corner, not drinking, not talking, merely watching
him. Are they closing in, tightening their net? Will they pick him up
tomorrow or the day after and tell him he must return to his master
in Ulan Bator? He buys a ticket to London, cancels it at the last
moment, and boards a plane that is about to leap over the pole to
California.</P>
<P>And suddenly he is in San Francisco. A toy city,
white and precious, rising on formidable hills and girdled by a
sparkling bay. He has never been here before. Odd how he expects
famous cities to be gigantic; this one, like Jerusalem, is
surprisingly small. Drop it down in Rome, in Nairobi, in crazy
sprawling Istanbul, and it would vanish altogether. Surprisingly
cold, too. California to him has always been a place of swimming
pools and palm trees, of football games played in bright warm
sunshine on wondrous January afternoons, but that California of the
mind must be somewhere else, probably down by Los Angeles; San
Francisco in June has a sullen late-winter feel, with sharp insistent
winds and gray, clinging fogs. Even when the fog burns away in the
afternoon and the city glitters in brilliant light under an intense
cloudless sky, the air still carries thechill of the ocean breezes,
and Shadrach huddles into his inadequate summer jacket.</P>
<P>There are no ancient palaces to see here, no
gazelles and ostriches running wild, no medieval ramparts or baroque
churches. But there are elegant streets of Victorian houses, from
grand mansions down to wooden bungalows, all of them delicately
ornamented with scrollwork and cornices and friezes and gables and
spires and even some stained-glass windows, most of the buildings in
fine preservation, survivors of fire, earthquake, insurrection,
biochemical warfare, and the collapse of the United States of America
itself. There are trees and shrubs everywhere, many in bloom; this
city, chilly or not, is nearly as flowery as Nairobi, and he looks
with delight on trees that are great blazing masses of red blossoms,
on giant tree ferns and contorted wind-sculpted cypresses, on
hillsides dark with fragrant groves of eucalyptus. One long day he
walks clear across the city from the bay to the ocean, emerging out
of a lush dreamlike park to stand at the edge of the Pacific, staring
toward Mongolia. Somewhere thousands of kilometers to the northwest
Genghis Mao is awakening and beginning his morning exercises.
Shadrach wonders about the current kidney functions of Genghis Mao,
his pulse rate, his calcium-phosphate levels, his endocrine balances,
all the myriad twitching bits of information he was so accustomed to
receiving. He realizes that he has begun to miss the broadcasts from
Genghis Mao's body. He misses the daily challenge of sustaining the
Chairman's indomitable but increasingly vulnerable inner
mechanisms.He may even miss Genghis Mao himself. Ah, strange, dark,
mysterious! Ah, the Hippocratic compulsions!</P>
<P>How goes it with the Khan? The Khan still lives
and thrives, judging by the newspaper Shadrach buys&mdash;the first
he has bothered to look at in all the weeks of his journey&mdash;which
is strewn with photographs of Mangu's funeral, held last week with
Pharaonic pomp and majesty. There is Genghis Mao himself, in full
mourning regalia, riding in the vast procession. There he is again,
benevolently blessing the millions crammed into Sukhe Bator Square.
<I>(Millions? </I>Well, so it says. Thousands, more likely.) And
again, and again, the Khan doing this, the Khan doing that, the Khan
orchestrating all the remaining energies of this bedraggled planet in
a global outpouring of grief. Ulan Bator, Shadrach discovers, is to
be renamed Altan Mangu, &quot;Golden Mangu.&quot; This seems
comically excessive to Shadrach, but he supposes he will get used to
the new name in time; the old one, which means &quot;Red Hero,'' has
been obsolete anyway since the fall of the People's Republic in 1995,
and Genghis Mao has been thinking for years of changing it to
something more appropriate. Well, Altan Mangu will do well enough,
Shadrach decides. A noise in place of a noise. Pages and pages of
coverage of the funereal rites! Not even a President of the United
States would have received such a spread. And the funeral was <I>last
</I>week; have they been running batches of photos like this every
day since then? Probably. Probably. The funeral is the big story of
the month, bigger even than the news of Mangu's death, which happened
too quickly, which lacked the linear extension in time that makes for
really big news. What other news is there, anyway? That people are
dying of organ-rot? That the Committee is nobly endeavoring to insure
a major increase in the supplies of the Antidote, real soon now? That
the Chairman's personal physician is loose on an aimless jaunt around
the world while, in some corner of his woolly skull, he plots ways to
thwart the Chairman's scheme to take possession of his body? Funeral
pictures are much more interesting than any of that.</P>
<P>So much fuss, in an American newspaper, about a
funeral in Mongolia. Shadrach finds himself thinking about the final
president of the United States &mdash;someone named Williams, he
thinks, or maybe Richards, at any rate a first name turned into a
last name&mdash;and what sort of funeral <I>he </I>had. Seven
mourners and a muddy grave on a rainy day, most likely. (Roberts?
Edwards? The name has slipped through his memory, beyond recapture.)
There still were presidents of the United States when Shadrach was a
boy, even a living ex-president or two. He tries to remember who the
president was when he was born. A man named Ford, wasn't it? Yes,
Ford. Most people liked Ford, Shadrach remembers. Before him there
was one named Nixon, whom people did not like, and one named Kennedy,
who was shot, and Truman, Eisenhower, Johnson, Roosevelt&mdash;resonant
names, sturdy American-sounding names. Our leaders, our great men.
What is the name of our leader now? Genghis II Mao IV Khan. Who would
believe that, in the old United States before the Virus War? Would
George Washington have believed it? Would Lincoln? The final year
before the PRC took over there were seven presidents, some of them
simultaneously. It used to be that the country needed thirty or forty
years to run through seven presidents, but there were seven all in
one year, in 1995. There used to be emperors in Rome, too, and
Augustus or Hadrian would probably have been surprised at the quality
and racial origin of some of them toward the end of the imperial era,
the ones who were Goths and the ones who were boys and the ones who
were madmen and the ones who ruled six days before their own palace
guards strangled them in disgust. Well, Lincoln would have been
surprised to find Americans accepting someone named Genghis II Mao IV
Khan as their leader. Or maybe not. Lincoln might have believed that
people get the governments they deserve, and that we must have
deserved Genghis Mao. Lincoln might even have liked the gaudy old
monster.</P>
<P>San Francisco is a fine city for walking. The
scale of the place is modest and human, so that one can move from one
neighborhood to another, from the mansions of Pacific Heights to the
sunny fantasy-Mediterranean of the Marina, from Russian Hill to the
Wharf, from the Mission to the Haight, in a single short brisk jaunt,
with a constantly changing and always agreeable urban texture all the
way. Neither wind nor fog nor steepness of hill is a serious handicap
in such an amiable environment. And the city is alive. There are
shops, restaurants, coffeehouses; the waterfront districts offer half
a dozen big carpentry chapels of competing sects, a dream-death
house, a den of transtemporalists; the people in the streets give the
illusion of good health and high spirits, and though Shadrach knows
it must be only an illusion, it is a persuasive one. The only thing
wrong with San Francisco is the profusion of Citpols.</P>
<P>There are more policemen here than he has ever
seen in any one place, more even than in Ulan Bator itself. It is as
though every ninth San Franciscan has enrolled in the Citizens' Peace
Brigade. Maybe it is only a delusion of his troubled mind, or maybe
the unusual vitality of this city requires a correspondingly unusual
quota of policing: at any rate, there are gray-and-blue uniforms
everywhere, <I>everywhere, </I>usually in pairs but not infrequently
in clumps of three, four, five. Most of them have the mechanical
insectoid look that seems to be characteristic of their kind, that
makes Shadrach suspect that Citpols are not born and trained but
rather are stamped out in some ghastly factory deep in the Caucasus.
And they all are watching him. Watching, watching, watching&mdash;it
<I>can't </I>be mere paranoia. Can it? Those dull gray watchful eyes,
hard, stupid, purposeful, studying him from all angles as he strides
through the city? Why are they looking at him so intently? What do
they want to know? They are going to arrest me soon, Shadrach tells
himself. He is certain that he has been under surveillance since his
departure. He is positive that Avogadro is receiving information on
his movements and is filing daily reports with Genghis Mao; and&mdash;is
it his own growing tension that makes it seem that way, or is the
tension in Genghis Mao?&mdash;the intensity of the surveillance
appears to have been increasing, from Nairobi to Jerusalem, from
Jerusalem to Istanbul, from Istanbul to Rome, first a casual Citpol
or two glancing offhandedly at him, then more overt scrutiny, then
teams of them following him about, hovering, staring, conferring,
charting his movements, until, perhaps in San Francisco, perhaps not
until he reaches Peking, they get the orders from the capital and
make their move, dozens of them on the housetops, in doorways, on
street-corners: <I>All right, Mordecai, come quietly and you won't
get hurt</I>&mdash;</P>
<P>And then, when he is at Broadway and Grant, about
to turn downhill into teeming Chinatown and speculating darkly about
the three Cirpols clustered outside an Oriental grocery store across
the street, someone shouts at him from the far side of Broadway,
&quot;Mordecai? Hey, Shadrach Mordecai!&quot;</P>
<P>At the sound of his name Shadrach freezes, impaled
in mid-fantasy, knowing that the game is up, that the moment he has
feared is at hand.</P>
<P>But the man approaching him, moving in awkward
dragging lurches through the traffic, is no Citpol. He is a burly,
balding man with a seamed weary face and a thick unkempt
gray-streaked beard, who is clad in threadbare green overalls, a
heavy plaid shirt, a faded red cloak. When he reaches Shadrach's side
he puts his hand on Shadrach's forearm in a way that seems to be
asking for support as much as for attention, and thrusts his face
close to Shadrach's, assuming intimacy so brazenly that Shadrach does
not resist the encroachment. The man's eyes are watery and swollen:
one of the organ-rot sympiomata. But he is still capable of smiling.
&quot;Doctor,&quot; he says. His voice is warm, furry, insinuating,
&quot;Hey, Doctor, how's it going?&quot;</P>
<P>A drunk. Probably not dangerous, though there is a
vague sense of menace about him, &quot;I didn't know I was such a
celebrity here.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Celebrity. Celebrity. Yeah, you're fucking
famous. At least to me you are. I spotted you from all the way across
Broadway. Not that you 've changed so much.'' The man is definitely
drunk.  He has that heavy, overly ingratiating warmth; he is
practically hanging from Shadrach's arm. &quot;You don't recognize
me, do you?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Should I?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Depends. You knew me pretty well once.&quot;</P>
<P>Shadrach searches the jowly, ravaged face.
Distantly familiar, but no name comes to mind. &quot;Harvard,&quot;
he guesses. &quot;It must have been Harvard. Right?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Two points. Keep going.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Medical school?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Try the college.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That's harder. That goes back better than
fifteen years.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Take fifteen years off me. And about twenty
kilos. And the beard. Shit, you haven't changed at all. Of course you
live an easy life. I know what you've been doing.&quot; The man
shuffles his feet and, without relinquishing his grip on Shadrach's
arm, twists away, coughs, hawks, spits. Bloody sputum. He grins.
&quot;Piece of my gut there, eh? Lose a little more every day. You
really don't recognize me. What the hell, all us white boys look
alike.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Want to give me more hints?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Big one. We were on the track team
together.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Shotput,&quot; Shadrach says instantly,
feeling the datum rise out of God knows what recess of his memory
banks and certain that it is correct.</P>
<P>&quot;Two points. Now the name.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Not yet. I'm groping for it.&quot; He
transforms this ruin into a young man, beardless, brawn where he has
fat today, in T-shirt and shorts, hefting the gleaming metal globe,
going into the bizarre little wind-up dance of the shotputter, making
his heave&mdash;</P>
<P>&quot;The NCAA meet, Boston, '95. Our sophomore
year. You won the sixty-meter sprint in six seconds even. Very nice.
And I took the shotput at twenty-one meters. Our pictures in all the
newspapers. Remember? The first big track event after the Virus War,
a sign that things were getting back to normal. Hah. Normal. You were
one hell of a runner, Shadrach. I bet you still are. Shit, I couldn't
even <I>lift </I>the shot now. What's my name?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ehrenreich,&quot; Shadrach says immediately.
&quot;Jim Ehrenreich.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Six points! And you're the big man's doctor
now. You said you'd be of some use to humanity, you weren't going
into medicine just to make a buck, eh? And you were right on. Serving
humanity, keeping our glorious leader alive. Why do you look so
surprised ? You think nobody knows the name of the Chairman's
doctor?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I don't try to get much publicity,&quot;
Shadrach says. 
</P>
<P>&quot;True. But we know a little about what goes
on in Ulan Bator. I was Committee, you know. Until last year. Where
are you heading? Chinatown? Let's walk together. Standing still like
this, it's bad for my legs, the varicose veins. I was Committee,
third from the top in Northern California, even had a vector-access
rating. Of course they dropped me. But don't worry: you won't get
into trouble talking to me. Even with those Citpols standing over
there watching. I'm not a fucking pariah, you know. I'm just
ex-Committee. I'm allowed to taik to people.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;What happened?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I was dumb. I had this friend, she was
Committee too, very low echelon, and her brother caught the rot. She
said to me, Can you jigger the computer, get a bigger requisition of
the Antidote, save my brother? Sure, I said, I would, I'll do it,
only for you, kid. I knew this computer man. He could jigger the
numbers. So I asked him, and he did it, at least I thought he was
doing it, but it was only a trap, a sucker deal, pure entrapment&mdash;the
Citpols stepped in, asked me to account for the extra Antidote
allotment I had requested&mdash;'' Ehrenreich blinks cheerfully,
&quot;They sent her to the organ farm. Her brother died. Me they
simply dropped, no further punishment. Very fucking lucky. On account
of my years of devoted service to the Permanent Revolution. I even
get a little allowance, enough to keep me in vodka. But it was a
waste, Shadrach, a stupid waste. They should have sent me to the
organ farm too, while I was still whole. Because now I'm dying. You
know that, don't you?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;They say that if you've been on the
Antidote, and you go off it, you generally get the rot right away.
It's like the pent-up force of the disease busts loose and conquers
you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I've heard that, yes,&quot; Shadrach says.</P>
<P>&quot;How long do I have? You can tell that, can't
you?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Not without examining you. Maybe not even
then. I'm not exactly an expert on the rot.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No. No. You wouldn't be. Not in Ulan Bator.
You don't get enough exposure there. I've had it six months. My beard
was black when I got it. I had all my hair then. I'm going to die,
Shadrach.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;We're all going to die. Except maybe for
Genghis Mao.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You know what I mean. I'm not even
thirty-seven years old and I'm going to <I>die. </I>I'm going to rot
and die. Because I was dumb, because I wanted to help the brother of
a friend. I had it made, I was home safe, the Antidote in my arm
every six months.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&quot;You really were dumb,&quot; Shadrach tells
him. &quot;Because nothing you could have done would have helped your
friend's brother.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Eh?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The Antidote doesn't cure. It immunizes.
Once the lethal stage sets in, that's it. The disease can't be
reversed. Didn't you know that? I thought everybody knew that.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;No. No.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You smashed your career for nothing. Threw
away your life for nothing.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No,&quot; Ehrenreich says. He looks stunned.
&quot;It can't be true. I don't believe it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Look it up.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No,&quot; he says. &quot;I want you to save
me, Shadrach. I want you to prescribe the Antidote for me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I just told you&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You knew what I was going to ask. You were
trying to head me off.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Please, Jim&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But you could get the stuff. You're probably
traveling with a hundred ampoules in your little black bag. Shit,
man, you're Genghis Mao's own doctor! You can do <I>anything. </I>It's
not like being third from the top in a regional office. Look, we were
on the same team, we won trophies together, we had our pictures in
the paper&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It wouldn't work, Jim.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You're afraid to help me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I ought to be, after what you just told me.
You got dropped for illegal diversion of the Antidote, you say, and
then you turn around and ask me to do the same thing.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It's different. You're the doctor of&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Even so. There's no point in giving you the
Antidote, for reasons that I've just explained. But even if there
were, I couldn't get any for you. I'd never get away with it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You don't want to risk your ass. Even for an
old friend.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, I don't. And I don't want to be made to
feel guilty for refusing to do something that doesn't make any
sense.'' There is nothing gentle in Shadrach's voice. &quot;The
Antidote is useless to you now. Absolutely entirely useless. Get that
straight and keep it straight.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You wouldn't even try some on me? Just for
an experiment?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It's useless. Useless.&quot;</P>
<P>After a long pause Ehrenreich says, &ldquo;You
know what I wish, old buddy? That you find yourself in bad trouble
someday, that you find yourself right on the edge of the cliff and
you're hanging on by your fingernails. And some old buddy of yours
comes along, and you yell out to him, Save me, save me, the shits are
killing me! And he tromps on your hand and keeps on walking. That's
what I wish. So you'd find out what it's like. That's what I wish.&quot;</P>
<P>Shadrach shrugs. He can feel no anger toward a
dying man. Nor does he choose to talk about his own problems. He says
simply, &quot;If I could heal you, I would. But I can't.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;You won't even try.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There's nothing I can do. Will you believe
that?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I was sure you'd be the one. You if anybody.
Didn't even remember me. Won't lift a finger.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Shadrach says, &quot;Have you ever done any
carpentry, Jim?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;You mean, in the chapels? Never interested
me.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;It might help you. It won't cure what you
have, but it might make it easier for you to live with it. Carpentry
shows you patterns that you can't necessarily see for yourself. It
helps you sort what's real and important from what doesn't matter
much.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;So you're a carpentry nut?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I go now and then. Whenever things cut too
close. There are some chapels down by Fisherman's Wharf. I wouldn't
mind going now. Suppose you come down there with me. It'll do you
some good.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There's a bar at Washington and Stockton
that I go to a lot. Suppose we go there instead. Suppose you buy me
some drinks on your PRC card. Do me even more good,&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Bar first, then chapel?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;We'll see,&quot; Ehrenreich says. 
</P>
<P>The bar is dark, musty, a forlorn place. The
bartender is an automatic: card in slot, thumb to identification
plate, punch for drinks. They order martinis. Ehrenreich's truculence
subsides after his second drink; he grows morose and maudlin, but he
is less bitter now. &quot;I'm sorry I said what I did, man,&quot; he
multers.</P>
<P>&quot;Forget it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I really thought you'd be the one.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I wish I could be.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I don't wish any trouble on you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I'm in trouble already,&quot; Shadrach says.
&quot;Hanging on by my fingernails.&quot; He laughs. A new round of
drinks comes from the machine. He lifts his glass. &quot;Never mind.
Cheers, friend.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Cheers, man.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;After this one we'll go to the chapel,
right?&quot;</P>
<P>Ehrenreich shakes his head. &quot;Not me. It's not
for me, you know? Not now. Not right now. You go without me. Don't
nag me about it, just go without me.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;All right,&quot; Shadrach says.</P>
<P>He finishes his drink, touches Ehrenreich's arm
lightly in farewell&mdash;the man is glassy-eyed, inarticulate&mdash;and
finds a cab to take him down to the Wharf. But the chapel gives
Shadrach no ease today. His fingers tremble, his eyes will not focus,
he is unable to slip into the meditative state. After half an hour he
leaves. He sees a car full of Citpols in a lot up the block. They're
still watching him. There is a bearded man in street clothes in the
car, also. Ehrenreich? Is that possible? At this distance he can't
make out faces, but the heavy shoulders look about right, the
thinning hair is familiar. Shadrach scowls. He hails a taxi, goes
back to his hotel, packs, heads for the airport. Three hours later he
is on his way to Peking.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3><I>23</I></H3>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>In Peking, ensconced at the Hundred Gates Hotel in
the old legation quarter adjoining the Forbidden City district, where
Kublai Khan and Ch'ien-lung once held court, Shadrach begins once
more to detect emanations from Genghis Mao. He is still some twelve
hundred or thirteen hundred kilometers from Ulan Bator, he
calculates&mdash;beyond the optimum telemetering range, and so the
incoming impulses are blurred and faint. Then, too, after these weeks
of separation Shadrach is no longer as much in concord with the
broadcast from Genghis Mao's body as he had been. But when he sits
very still, when he tunes his attention perfectly to the task, he
finds himself able to read the old warlord's biodata with gradually
sharpening clarity.</P>
<P>The gross functions come in best, of course:
heartbeat, blood pressure, respiration, body temperature. The Khan's
major systems all seem to be thundering along at their usual level of
irrepressible vitality. Liver and kidney action register in their
normal range. Basal metabolic expenditure normal. Neuromus-cular
responses normal. It never ceases to amaze Shadrach how healthy, how
strong, the old man is. He takes a certain vicarious pride in Genghis
Mao's heroic durability and resilience.</P>
<P>Some unexpected puzzles begin to develop, though,
as Shadrach extends his reach and starts to bring in the subtler,
more refined data. These tend to contradict some of the gross
indications. The muscle-firing responses do not seem quite right&mdash;
phosphate breakdown appears weak, enzyme activity off. Blood
viscosity is lower than normal and blood pH is nudging slightly
toward the alkaline. Intestinal absorption is minutely down,
cholesterol accumulation up, perspiration a trifle above normal. None
of these things is cause for real alarm in a man of the Chairman's
age who has recently undergone so much radical surgery&mdash;it is
hardly reasonable to expect htm to be in perfect health&mdash;but the
combination of factors is peculiar. Shadrach wonders how much of what
he is reading is simply an artifact of distance and noise on the
line: he is straining for some of these inputs, and he may not be
getting them accurately. Still, the distortions, if distortions they
are, are remarkably consistent. He gets the same reading whenever he
returns to any sensor.</P>
<P>And a hypothesis is starling to take shape.</P>
<P>Diagnosis at more than a thousand kilometers'
range is tricky. Shadrach misses his medical library and his
computers. But he has an idea of what the problem may be, and he
knows what data he needs to confirm his theory. What he does not know
is whether Buckmaster's implant system is good enough to transmit
analogues of such small-scale phenomena across so great a distance.</P>
<P>If blood viscosity is down and blood pH is
alkaline, plasma protein levels are probably subnormal, and osmotic
pressure, which draws fluids from the tissues to the capillaries, is
going to be low. If the hydrostatic blood pressure is normal, as the
gross function modulator is telling him, and the osmotic blood
pressure is off, Genghis Mao's tissues may be building up an
accumulation of excess fluids&mdash;not serious, not dangerous, not
yet, but such fluid accumulations may be leading toward the
development of edemas, of watery swellings, and edemas can be
symptomatic of impending failure in the kidneys, the liver, perhaps
the cardiac system. Bearing down in intense concentration, Shadrach
roves Genghis Mao's body in search of signs of excess fluid. The
lymphatic-system checkpoints give him nothing but normal levels,
though. The reports from the pericardial, pleural, and peritoneal
outposts are positive. Renal and hepatic functions, as before, are
fine. Nothing seems to be wrong. Shadrach begins to abandon his
hypothesis. Perhaps the Khan is not in difficulties. Those few
negative indications were probably just noise on the line, and
therefore&mdash;</P>
<P>But then Shadrach notices that something is not
quite right in Genghis Mao's skull. Intracranial pressure is
unusually high.</P>
<P>The implant monitors in the Chairman's cranium are
not as comprehensive as they are elsewhere. Genghis Mao has no
history of stroke or other cerebrovascular events, and surgeons have
never had reason to invade the imperial skull. Since most of the
telemetering equipment in Genghis Mao has been installed during the
course of routine corrective surgery, Shadrach must make do with
relatively skimpy coverage of the state of the Chairman's brain. But
he does have a sensor that reports to him on intracranial pressure,
and, as he makes his total scan of Genghis Mao's body, the rise in
that pressure catches his attention. Is that where the fluid buildup
is taking place?</P>
<P>Struggling, stretching for the data, Shadrach
pulls in whatever correlative information he can grab. Osmotic
pressure of the cranial capillaries? Low. Hydrostatic pressure?
Normal. Meningeal distension? High. Condition of the cerebral
ventricles? Congested. Something is awry, very marginally awry, in
the system that drains cerebrospinal fluid from the interior of
Genghis Mao's brain to the subarachnoid space, next to the skull
wall, whereit normally passes into the blood.</P>
<P>What this means, at the moment, is that Genghis
Mao probably has been having bad headaches for a few days, that he
will have worse ones if Shadrach Mordecai does not return to Ulan
Bator at once, and that he may suffer brain damage&mdash;possibly
fatal&mdash;if prompt corrective action is not taken. It means, also,
that Shadrach's holiday is at its end. He will not do the sightseeing
tour of Peking. Not for him the visit to the Forbidden City, the
historical museum, the Ming tombs, the Great Wall, the temple of
Confucius, the Working People's Palace of Culture. Those things are
unimportant to him now: this is the moment for which he was waiting
during his wanderings from continent to continent. The unstable
system that is Genghis II Mao IV Khan has, in the absence of the
devoted physician, begun to break down. Shadrach's indispensability
has been made manifest. He is needed. He must go to his patient
immediately. He must take the appropriate actions. He has his
Hippocratic obligations to fulfill. He has his own survival to think
about, besides.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Shadrach descends to the hotel lobby to arrange
for a seat aboard the next flight to Ulan Bator&mdash;there is one
that evening, he learns, leaving in two and a half hours&mdash;and to
check out of the room he so recently checked into. The clerk, a gaunt
young Chinese who is unable to contain his fascination with the color
of Shadrach's skin, staring and staring with surreptitious sideways
glances, comments on the brevity of his stay in Peking.</P>
<P>&quot;Change of plan,&quot; Shadrach declares
resonantly. &quot;Urgent business. Must return at once.&quot;</P>
<P>He glances down the length of the lobby&mdash;a
dim, fragrant space, like the vestibule of some enormous Chinese
restaurant, cluttered with mahogany screens and porcelain urns and
huge lacquer bowls on rosewood pedestals&mdash;and sees, towering
above a pair of porters, the husky, hulking figure of Avogadro. Their
eyes meet and Avogadro smiles, nods bis head in salute, waves a hand.
He has just arrived at the hotel, it seems. Shadrach is not at all
surprised to discover the security chief here. It was inevitable, he
decides, that Avogadro would show up to make the arrest in person.</P>
<P>Neither of them remarks on the coincidence of
their presence in this exotic place. Avogadro asks amiably, &quot;How
have you been enjoying your travels, Doctor?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I've seen a great deal of the world. Most
interesting.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;That's the best word you can choose?
Interesting? Not overwhelming, illuminating, transcendental?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Interesting,&quot; Shadrach repeats
deliberately. &quot;A very interesting trip. And how is Genghis Mao
bearing up in my absence?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Not too badly.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;He's well looked after. He likes to think
I'm indispensable, but the relief staff is quite capable of handling
most of what's likely to come up.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Probably so.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But he's been having headaches, hasn't he?&quot;
</P>
<P>Avogadro looks mildly startled. &quot;You know
that, do you?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'm just at the edge of the telemetering
range here.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;And you can detect his <I>headaches?&quot; </I>
</P>
<P>&quot;I can pick up certain causal factors,&quot;
Shadrach says, &quot;and deduce a headache from them.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;How clever that system is. You and the Khan
are practically one person, wouldn't that be so? Connected the way
you are. He aches and you feel it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well put,&quot; Shadrach says. &quot;Actually,
Nikki was the first one to make that point to me. Genghis Mao and I
are one person, yes, one united information-processing unit.
Comparable to the sculptor and the marble and the chisel.&quot;</P>
<P>The analogy does not appear to register with
Avogadro. He continues to smile the fixed, determinedly affable smile
that he has been smiling since they first approached one another in
the lobby.</P>
<P>&quot;But not united closely enough,&quot;
Shadrach goes on. &quot;The system could be linked even more tightly.
I plan to talk to the engineers about building some modifications
into it, when I get back to Ulan Bator.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Which will be when?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Tonight,&quot; Shadrach tells him. &quot;I'm
booked on the next flight out.&quot;</P>
<P>Avogadro's eyebrows rise. &quot;You are? How
convenient Saves me the trouble of&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Asking me to return?&quot;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&quot;I thought you might have had something like
that in mind.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;The truth is that Genghis Mao misses you. He
sent me down here to talk to you.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Of course.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;To ask you to come back.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;He sent you to ask me that. Not to <I>bring
</I>me<I>, </I>but to <I>ask</I> me. If I would return. Of my own
free will.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;To ask, yes.&quot;</P>
<P>Shadrach thinks of the Citpols keeping tabs on him
all around the world, huddling, conferring, passing bulletins on to
their colleagues in distant cities. He knows, and he is sure that
Avogadro knows that he knows, that the real situation is not as
casual as Avogadro would have him believe. By buying that ticket on
this evening's flight, he has spared Avogadro the embarrassment of
having to take him into custody and return him to Ulan Bator under
duress. He hopes Avogadro is properly grateful for that.</P>
<P>He says, &quot;How bad are the Khan's headaches?&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;Pretty bad, I'm told.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;You haven't seen him?&quot;</P>
<P>Avogadro shakes his head. &quot;Only on the
telephone. He looked drawn. Tired.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;How long ago was this?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The night before last. But there's been talk
in the tower all week about the Chairman's headaches.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I see,&quot; Shadrach says. &quot;I thought
it might be like that. That's why I've decided to go back ahead of
schedule.&quot; His eyes rest squarely on Avogadro's. &quot;You
understand that, don't you? That I bought my return ticket as soon as
I realized the Khan was in discomfort? Because it was my
responsibility to my patient. My responsibility to my patient is
always the controlling factor in my actions. Always. Always. You're
aware of that, aren't you?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Naturally,&quot; Avogadro says.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><I>June 23, 2012</I></P>
<P><I>What if I had died before my work was done? Not
an idle question at all. I</I> <I>am important to history. I am one
of the great reconstituters of society. Subtract me from the scene in
1995, in 1998, even as late as 2001, and everything tumbles into
chaos. I am to this society as Augustus was to the Roman world, as
Ch'in Shih Huang Ti was to China. What kind of world would exist
today if I had perished ten years ago? A thousand warring
principalities, no doubt, each with its own pathetic army, its own
legislature, currency, passports, border guards, customs levies. A
host of petty aristocracies, feudal overlords, secret cabals of
malcontents, constant little revolutions&mdash;chaos, chaos, chaos.
New outbreaks of virus warfare, very likely. And ultimately the
extinction of mankind. All this if you subtract Genghis Mao at the
critical moment in history. I am the world-savior.</I></P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><I>It sounds obscenely boastful. </I>World-savior!
<I>Culture-hero, myth-figure, I, Hrishna, I, Quetzalcoatl, I, Arthur,
I, Genghis Mao. And yet it is true, truer for me than for any of
them, for without me all of mankind might be dead today, and that is
new in the history of the savior-myth. To end the strife, to seal
away the virus, to sponsor Roncevic's work</I>&mdash;<I>yes, no doubt
of it, this could have been a dead planet by now if I had gone into
the tomb ten years ago. As history will recognize. And yet, and yet,
what does it matter? I will not be forgotten when I die</I>&mdash;<I>I
will never be forgotten&mdash;but </I>I <I>will die. Sooner, later,
my subterfuges will exhaust themselves. Neither Talos nor Phoenix nor
Avatar can sustain me indefinitely. Something will fail, or boredom
will conquer me and I will terminate my own systems, and I will die,
and then what will it have meant to have saved the world? What I have
done is ultimately meaningless to me. The power I have attained is
ultimately empty. Not immediately empty&mdash;here I sit, do I not,
among splendor and comfort?</I>&mdash;<I>but </I>ultimately <I>empty.
I pretend that there is meaning in empire, but there is none, no
meaning anywhere. This is a philosophy common among the very young,
and, I suppose, among the very old. I must pretend that power is
important to me. I must pretend that the reckoning of history is the
all-consoling consolation. But I am too old to care. I have forgotten
why it mattered to me to do what I have done. I am playing out a
foolish game, unwilling to let it reach its end, but unsure of the
nature of the winning gambit. And so I go on and on and on. I,
Genghis II Mao IV Khan, savior of the world, taking care to conceal
from those around me the profound and paralyzing vacancy that lies
beneath the subcellars of my spirit. I think I have lost the thread
of my own argument. I am tired. I am bored. My head hurts. My head
hurts.</I></P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Shadrach!&quot; Genghis Mao roars. &quot;This
filthy headache! Fix me, Shadrach!&quot;</P>
<P>The old buccaneer forces a grin. He sits propped
up against triple pillows, looking weary and frayed. His jaws are set
in a rigid grimace; his ryes have a harsh glare and they waver
frantically as though he is struggling to keep them in focus. At this
close range Shadrach can easily detect a dozen different symptoms of
the pressure building up in the recesses of the Chairman's brain.
Already there are many tiny signs of deterioration in Genghis Mao's
cerebral functions. No doubt of the diagnosis now. No doubt of it.</P>
<P>&quot;You were away too long,&quot; the Khan
mutters. &quot;Enjoying yourself? Yes. But the headache, Shadrach,
the miserable hideous headache&mdash;I shouldn't have let you go.
Your place is here. Beside me. Watching me. Healing me. It was like
sending my right hand on a voyage around the world. You won't go away
again, will you, Shadrach? And you'll fix my head? It frightens me.
The throbbing. Like something trying to escape in there.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;There's no reason to worry, sir. We'll fix
you soon enough.&quot;</P>
<P>Genghis Mao rolls his eyes in torment. &quot;How?
Chop a hole in my skull? Let the demon escape like a whiff of foul
gas?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;This isn't the Neolithic,&quot; Shadrach
says. &quot;The trephine is obsolete. We have better methods.&quot;
He touches the tips of his fingers to the Khan's cheeks, probing for
the sharp, upthrusting bones. &quot;Relax, sir. Let the muscles go
slack.&quot; It is late at night, and Shadrach is exhausted, having
flown this day from San Francisco to Peking, from Peking to Ulan
Bator, having gone at once to Genghis Mao's bedside without pausing
even for fresh clothing. His mind is a muddle of time zones and he is
not sure whether he is in Saturday, Sunday, or Friday. But there is a
sphere of utter crystalline clarity at the core of his spirit.
&quot;Relax,&quot; he croons. &quot;Relax. Let the tension flow out
of your neck, out of your shoulders, out of your back. Easy, now,
easy&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>Genghis Mao scoffs. &quot;You aren't going to cure
this with massages and soothing talk.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But we can ease the symptoms this way. We
can palliate, sir.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And then?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;If necessary, there are surgical remedies.&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;You see? You <I>will </I>chop open my
skull!&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;We'll be neat about it, I promise.&quot;
Shadrach moves around behind Genghis Mao, so he will not be
distracted by the need to maintain eye contact with the fierce old
man, and concentrates on diagnostic perceptions. Hydrostatic
imbalance, yes; roeningeal congestion, yes; some accumulation of
metabolic wastes about the brain, yes. The situation is far from
critical&mdash;action could be deferred for weeks, perhaps for many
months, without great risk&mdash;but Shadrach intends to deal swiftly
with the problem. And not only for Genghis Mao's sake. 
</P>
<P>Genghis Mao says, &quot;It's good to have you
back.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Thank you, sir.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You should have been here for the funeral.
You would have had a front-row seat. It was magnificent, Shadrach.
Did you watch the funeral on television?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Of course,&quot; Shadrach lies. &quot;In&mdash;ah&mdash;in
Jerusalem. I think I was in Jerusalem then. Yes. Magnificent. Yes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Magnificent,&quot; says Genghis Mao,
dwelling lovingly on the word. &quot;It will never be forgotten. One
of history's great spectacles. I was proud of it. The Assyrians
couldn't have done better for old Sardanapalus.&quot; The Khan
laughs. &quot;If one can't attend one's own funeral, Shadrach, one
can at least satisfy the urge by staging a splendid funeral for
someone else. Eh? Eh?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I wish I could have been there, sir.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;But you were in Jerusalem. Or was it
Istanbul?&quot;</P>
<P> &quot;Jerusalem, I think, sir.&quot; He touches
Genghis Mao's temples, pressing lightly but firmly. The Chairman
winces. When Shadrach presses the sides of Genghis Mao's neck, just
below and behind the ears, the Chairman grunts. &quot;Tender there,&quot;
Genghis Mao says. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;How bad is it, really?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It's not good. No immediate danger, but
there's definitely a problem in there.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Explain it to me.&quot;</P>
<P>Shadrach moves out where Genghis Mao can see him.
&quot;The brain and spinal cord,&quot; he says, &quot;float,
literally float, in a liquid we call cerebrospinal fluid, which is
manufactured in hollow chambers within the brain known as ventricles.
It protects and nourishes the brain and, when it drains into the
spaces surrounding the brain, it carries off the metabolic wastes
resulting from the brain's activity. Under certain circumstances the
passageways from the ventricles to these meningeal spaces become
blocked, and cerebrospinal fluid accumulates in the ventricles.&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;Is that what's happening to my head?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;So it seems.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Why?&quot;</P>
<P>Shrugging, Shadrach replies, &quot;It's usually
caused by infection or by a tumor at the base of the brain.
Occasionally it comes on spontaneously, without observable lesion. A
function of aging, maybe.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;And what are the effects?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;In children, the skull enlarges as the
ventricles swell. That's the condition known as hydrocephalus, water
on the brain. The adult cranium isn't capable of expansion, of
course, so the brain must bear all the pressure. Severe headaches are
the first symptom, naturally. Followed by failure of physical
coordination, vertigo, facial paralysis, gradual loss of eyesight,
periods of coma, general impairments of cerebral functions, epileptic
seizures&mdash;&ldquo;</P>
<P>&quot;And death?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Death, yes. Eventually.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;How long from first to last?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It depends on the degree of the blockage,
the vigor of the patient, and a lot of other factors. Some people
live for years with mild or incipient hydrocephalic conditions and
aren't even aware of it. Even acute cases can drag on for years, with
long periods of remission. On the other hand, it's possible to go
from first congestion to mortality in a matter of months, and
sometimes much more quickly even than that, if something like a
medullary edema develops, an intracranial swelling that disrupts the
autonomic systems.&quot;</P>
<P>These recitals of symptomatology and prognosis
have always fascinated Genghis Mao, and intense interest is evident
in his eyes now. But there is something else, a haunted look, a
flashing look of dismay verging on terror, that Shadrach has never
observed in him before.</P>
<P>The Chairman says, &quot;And in my case?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;We'll have to run a full series of tests, of
course. But on the basis of what the implants are telling me, I'm
inclined toward quick corrective surgery.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I've never had brain surgery.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I know that, sir.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I don't like the whole idea. A kidney or a
lung is trivial. I don't want Warhaftig's lasers inside my head. I
don't want pieces of my mind cut away.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There's no question of our doing that.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What will you do, then?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It's strictly a decompressive therapy. We'll
install valved tubes to shunt the excess fluid directly into the
jugular system. The operation is relatively simple and much less
risky than an organ transplant.&quot;</P>
<P>Genghis Mao smiles icily. &quot;I'm accustomed to
organ transplants, though. I think I <I>like </I>organ transplants.
Brain surgery is something new for me.&quot;</P>
<P>Shadrach, as he prepares a sedative for the
Chairman, says cheerfully, &quot;Perhaps you'll come to like brain
surgery as well, sir.&quot;</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>In the morning he seeks out Frank Ficifolia at the
main communications nexus deep in the service core of the tower. &quot;I
heard you'd returned,&quot; Ficifolia says. &quot;I heard it, but I
didn't believe it. For Christ's sake, why'd you come back?&quot;</P>
<P>Shadrach eyes the banks of screens and monitors
warily. &quot;Is it safe to talk here?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Jesus, do you think I'd bug my own office?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Someone might have done it without telling
you about it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Talk,&quot; Ficifolia says. &quot;It's safe
here.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;If you say so.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I say so. Why didn't you stay where you
were?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The Citpols knew where I was, every minute.
Avogadro himself dropped in on me in Peking.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What did you expect? Taking commercial
transport all around the world. There are ways of hiding, but&mdash;did
Avogadro make you come back here, then?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I had already bought my ticket.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Jesus, <I>why?&quot;</I></P>
<P>&quot;I came back because I saw a way of saving
myself.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The way to save yourself is to go
underground.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No,&quot; Shadrach says emphatically. &quot;The
way to save yourself is to return and continue to carry out my
functions as the Chairman's doctor. You know that the Chairman is
ill?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Bad headaches, they tell me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Dangerous headaches. We'll need to operate.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Brain surgery?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That's right.&quot;</P>
<P>Ficifolia compresses his lips and studies
Shadrach's face as though examining a map of El Dorado. &quot;I once
told you that you weren't crazy enough to survive in this city. Maybe
I was wrong.  Maybe you're plenty crazy. You <I>have </I>to be crazy
if you think you can intentionally bungle an operation on Genghis Mao
and get away with it. Don't you think Warhaftig will notice what
you're doing and stop you? Or turn you in, if you actually do pull it
off? What good is killing the Khan if you end up in the organ farms
yourself? How&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Doctors don't kill their patients, Frank.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You're jumping to conclusions. Projecting
your own fantasies, perhaps. I'm simply going to operate. And cure
the Chairman's headaches. And see to it that he stays in good
health.&quot; Shadrach smiles. &quot;Don't ask questions. Just help
me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Help you how?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I want you to find Buckmaster for me.
There's a special piece of equipment I'll need, and he's the right
man to build it. Then I'll want you to help me rig the telemetering
circuits to run it.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&quot;Buckmaster? Why Buckmaster? There are plenty
of capable microengineering people right here on the staff.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Buckmaster's the one I want for this job.
He's the best in his field, and he happens to be the one who built my
implant system. He's the one who ought to build any additions to that
system.'' Shadrach's gaze is uncompromising. &quot;Will you get me
Buckmaster?&quot;</P>
<P>Ficifolia, after a moment, blinks and brusquely
nods. &quot;I'll take you to him,&quot; be says. &quot;When do you
want to go?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Now.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Right now? Right this literal minute?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Now,&quot; Shadrach says. &quot;Is he very
far from here?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Not really.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Where is he?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Karakorum,&quot; Ficifolia replies. &quot;We
hid him among the transtemporalists.&quot;</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><I>January 2, 2009</I></P>
<P><I>I insisted, and they allowed me to sample the
transtemporal experience. Much talk of risks, of side effects, of my
responsibilities to the commonwealth. I overruled them. It is not
often that I have to </I>insist. <I>It</I> <I>is rare that I can
speak of </I>being <I>allowed.</I> <I>But this was a struggle. Which
of course I won, but it was work. Visited Karakorum after midnight,
light snow falling. The tent was cleared. Guards posted. Teixeira had
given me a full checkup first. Because of the drugs they use. Clean
bill of health: I can handle their most potent potions. And so, into
the tent. Dark place, foul smell. I remember that smell from my
childhood-burning cow-chips, uncured goathides. Little slump-backed
lama comes forth, very unimpressed with me, no awe at all</I>&mdash;<I>why
be awed by Genghis Mao, I guess, when you can gulp a drug and visit
Caesar, the Buddha, Genghis Khan?&mdash;and mixes his brews for me.
Oils, powders. Gives me the cup to drink. Sweet, gummy, not a good
taste. Takes my hands, whispers things to me, and I am dizzy and then
the tent becomes a cloud and is gone and I find myself in another
tent, wide and low, white flags and brocaded hangings, and there he
is before me, thick-bodied, short, a man of middle years or more long
dark mustache, small eyes, strong mouth, stink of sweat coming from
him as if he hasn't bathed in years, and for the first time in my
life I want to sink to my knees before another human being, for this
is surely Temujin, this is the Great Khan, this is he, the founder,
the conqueror.</I></P>
<P><I>I do not kneel, except within myself. Within
myself I fall at his feet. I offer him my hand. I bow my head.</I></P>
<P><I>&quot;Father Genghis,&quot; I say. &quot;Across
nine hundred years I come to do you homage.&quot;</I></P>
<P><I>He regards me without great interest. After a
moment he hands me a bowl. &quot;Drink some airag, old man.&quot;</I></P>
<P><I>We shared the bowl, I first, then the Great
Khan. He is dressed simply, no scarlet robes, no ermine trim, no
crown, just a warrior's leather costume. The top of his head is
shaven and in back his hair reaches his shoulders. He could kill me
with a slap of his left hand.</I></P>
<P><I>&quot;What do you want?&quot; he asks. </I>
</P>
<P><I>&quot;To see you.&quot; </I>
</P>
<P><I>&quot;You see me. What else?&quot; </I>
</P>
<P><I>&quot;To tell you that you will live forever.&quot;
</I>
</P>
<P><I>&quot;I will die like any man, old one.&quot; </I>
</P>
<P><I>&quot;Your body will die, Father Genghis. Your
name will live in the ages.&quot;</I></P>
<P><I>He considers that. &quot;And my empire? What of
that? Will my sons rule after me?&quot;</I></P>
<P><I>&quot;Your sons will rule over half the world.&quot;
</I>
</P>
<P><I>&quot;Half the world,&quot; Genghis Khan says
softly. &quot;Only half? Is this the truth, old man?&quot; </I>
</P>
<P><I>&quot;Cathay will be theirs</I>&mdash;&quot; 
</P>
<P>&ldquo;<I>Cathay is already mine.&quot;</I></P>
<P><I>&quot;Yes, but they will have it all, down to
the hot jungles. And they will rule the high mountains, and the
Russian land, and Turkestan, Afghanistan, Persia, everything as far
as the gates of Europe. Half the world. Father Genghis!&quot; </I>
</P>
<P><I>The Khan of Khan grunts.</I></P>
<P><I>&quot;And I tell you this, also. Nine hundred
years from now a khan named Genghis will rule everything from sea to
sea, from shore to shore, all souls upon this world naming him
master.&quot;</I></P>
<P><I>&quot;A khan of my blood?&quot; </I>
</P>
<P><I>&quot;A true Tatar,&quot; I assure him.</I></P>
<P><I>Genghis Khan is silent a long while. It is
impossible to read his eyes. He is shorter than I would have thought,
and his smell is bad, but he is a man of such strength and purpose
that I am humbled, for I</I> <I>thought I was of his kind, and in a
way I am, and yet he is more than I could ever have been. There is no
calculation about him; he is altogether solid, unhesitating, a man
who lives in the moment, a man who must never have paused for a
second thought and whose first thought must always have been right.
He is only a barbarian prince, a mere wild horseman of the Gobi, to
whom every aspect of my ordinary daily life would seem the most
dazzling magic: yet put him down in Ulan Bator and he would
understand the workings of Surveillance Vector One in three hours. A
barbarian he is, yes, but not a </I>mere <I>barbarian, not a mere
anything, and though I am his superior in some ways, though my life
and my power are beyond his comprehension, I am second to him in all
the ways that matter. He awes me. As I expected him to do. And,
seeing him, I come close to a willingness to yield up all my
authority over men, for, next to him, I am not worthy. I am not
worthy.</I></P>
<P><I>&quot;Nine hundred years,&quot; he says at
last, and the shadow of a smile crosses his face. &quot;Good. Good.&quot;
He claps for a servant. &quot;More airag,&quot; he calls. We share
another drink. Then he says he must depart; it is time to ride out
from Karakorum to the camp of his son Chagadai, where the royal
family is to hold a tourney today. He does not invite me to join him.
He has no interest in me, though I come from out of the realm of
distant time, though I bring him bright tales of Mongol empires to
come. I am unimportant to him. I have told him all he cares to know;
now I am forgotten. Only the tourney matters now. He leaps to his
mare; he rides away, followed by the warriors of his court, and only
the servant and I remain.</I></P>

<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Two robed acolytes bring Roger Buckmaster to
Shadrach out of the depths of the tent of the transtemporslists in
Karakorum. Buckmaster is robed too, but not in the coarse black
horsehair garb of a transtemporalist. He wears a heavy hooded cassock
of thick brown wool, smoothly woven. His feet, bare, are clad in open
sandals. A massive cruciform pendant dangles at his throat. He pushes
back his hood to reveal a tonsured scalp.</P>
<P>Buckmaster has become some sort of monk.</P>
<P>His new asceticism of clothing is not the only
change in him. Before, he had been a blurting, impatient, angry man,
with some kind of sullen furious energy circulating within him that
seemed dammed at every plausible point of exit. Now he is eerily
calm, self-contained, a man inhabiting an unfathomable kingdom of
solitude and peace. He is pale, very thin, almost spectral. He 
stands silently before Shadrach, fingering his beads but otherwise
motionless, waiting, waiting.</P>
<P>Shadrach says at last, &quot;I never expected to
see you alive again.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Life brings many surprises, Dr. Mordecai.&quot;
Buckmaster's voice is different too, deeper, sepulchral, more
resonant, all the sputter and frenzy burned out of it,</P>
<P>&quot;Word went around that you'd been sent to the
organ farm. Dissected, dismembered.&quot;</P>
<P>Piously Buckmaster says, &quot;The Lord chose to
spare me.&quot; 
</P>
<P>His piety is hard for Shadrach to take. &quot;Your
friends saved your skin, you mean,&quot; he retorts, instantly
regretting his bluntness. Not a wise way to talk to someone whose
services you need.</P>
<P>But Buckmaster does not seem offended. &quot;My
friends are His agents. As are we all. Dr. Mordecai.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Have you been here the whole time?&quot; 
</P>
<P>'' Yes. Since the day after you saw me under
interrogation.'' 
</P>
<P>&quot;And the Citpols haven't come sniffing around
for you?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I am officially dead, Doctor. My body has
officially been distributed to ailing members of the government: the
computer will tell you so. The Citpols don't search for dead men. To
them I'm no more man a set of scattered parts&mdash;a pancreas here,
a liver there, a kidney, a lung. Forgotten.&quot; For a moment
mischief gleams in Buckmaster's oddly solemn face. &quot;If you told
them I was here, they would deny it.&quot;</P>
<P> &quot;And what have you been doing?&quot;
Shadrach asks. 
</P>
<P>&quot;The transtemporalists regard me as a holy
man. I take their cup each day. Each day I retrace the days of the
life of our Lord. I have attended His Passion upon Calvary many
times. Doctor. I have walked among the apostles. I have touched the
hem of Mary's robe. I have beheld the miracles: Cana, Capernaum,
Lazarus raised at Bethany., I have watched Him betrayed in
Gethsemane. I have seen Him brought before Pilate. I have seen it
all, Dr. Mordecai, everything of which the Gospels tell. It is all
true. It is literally the truth. My eyes bear witness.&quot; The
unexpected intensity of conviction in Buckmaster's eyes, the
unearthly sound of Buckmaster's voice, leave Shadrach speechless a
moment. It is impossible not to believe that this scruffy little man
has strolled through the Galilee with Jesus and Peter and James, that
he has heard the sermons of John the Baptist and the lamentations of
the Magdalene. Illusion, hallucination, self-deceit, fraud; no
matter. Buckmaster has been transformed. He is radiant.</P>
<P>With deliberate bluntness Shadrach asks, &quot;Can
you still do microengineering work?&quot;</P>
<P>The irrelevance of the question catches Buckmaster
off balance. He is lost in holy reveries, shrouded in mystic serenity
and transcendental joy, and Shadrach's words bring a gasp of
amazement from him, as though he has been jabbed in the ribs. He
coughs and frowns and says, obviously baffled, &quot;I suppose I
could. It's never entered my mind.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I have work for you now.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Don't be preposterous, Doctor.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'm being altogether serious. I've come to
you because there's a job that you and only you can do properly.
You're the only one I'd trust to do it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The world has expelled me, Doctor. I have
expelled the world. Here is where I dwell. The concerns of the world
are no longer my concerns. &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You once were concerned about the injustices
perpetrated by Genghis Mao and the PRC.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I am beyond justice and injustice now.&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;Don't say that. It sounds impressive, Roger,
but it's dangerous nonsense. The sin of pride, isn't it? You were
rescued by your fellow men. You owe your life to them. They took
risks for you. You have obligations to them.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I pray for them daily.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There's something more immediately useful
you can do.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Prayer is the highest good I know,&quot;
Buckmaster says. &quot;Certainly I place it higher than
microengineering. I fail to see how any microengineering job you give
me can help my fellow men.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;One job can.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I fail to see&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Genghis Mao is soon to undergo another
operation.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;What's Genghis Mao to me? He's forgotten me.
I've forgotten him.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;An operation on his brain,&quot; Shadrach
continues. &quot;Fluid now accumulates within his skull. Unless it's
drained, it could kill him. Shortly we'll install a drainage system
with a valve through which the fluid can be removed. At the same time
a new telemetering implant will be installed in me. Which I want you
to design for me, Roger.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What will it do?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Allow me to control the action of the
valve,&quot; Shadrach says.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Two hours later Shadrach is in the great carpentry
chapel at the far end of the Karakorum pleasure complex, surrounded
by chisels and mallets and saws, trying to enter into the initial
meditative state. He is not doing well at it. Now and then he feels
just a bit of it, the beginning of the proper degree of
concentration, but he holds it no more than an instant and then, as
he congratulates himself for having attained the state at last, he
loses it, again and again he loses it. It is Buckmaster's fault.
Buckmaster will not recede from the forefront of Shadrach's
consciousness.</P>
<P>If Buckmaster had had his way, Shadrach would not
be among the carpenters at all right now, but rather still would be
in the transtemporalists' tent, lying drugged and limp while his soul
journeyed back through the millennia to attend the bloody rite of
Calvary. &quot;Take the cup with me,&quot; Buckmaster had urged. &quot;We
will visit the Passion together,&quot; But Shadrach had declined.
Some other time, he told Buckmaster gently. Transtemporal jaunts
consume too much energy; he needs all his strength for the difficult
enterprise that lies just ahead. Buckmaster had understood, or at
least was willing to forgive him for not caring to make the journey
just then. And Shadrach went forth from the tent, with Buckmaster's
promise that he would have the design of the new implant ready in a
day or so. And still Buckmaster haunts him.</P>
<P>How astonishing it was to see Buckmaster's
monkishness fall away from him the moment he grasped the implications
of Shadrach's request&mdash;his breath quickening, color coming to
his cheeks, eyes bright with the old frenzy. Asking a hundred
questions, demanding specifications and performance Thresholds, size
parameters, preferred bodily placement for the device. Scribbling
notes furiously. Half an hour was all it took him to work out the
rough schematics. He would need computer assistance to do the final,
he said, but that would be no problem: Ficifolia could hook up a
telephone relay for him, keying right into Genghis Mao's own master
computer. And Buckmaster laughed stridently. Abruptly his expression
shifted. Serenity returned. He had put microengineering aside;
suddenly he was a monk again, calm, remote, glacial, saying, &quot;Take
the cup with me. We will visit the Passion together.&quot; Poor crazy
Buckmaster.</P>
<P>Shadrach, struggling to regain his own serenity,
picks up an awl, lays it down, picks up an auger, runs his fingers
along the curved blade of a chisel, presses a bastard file against
his forehead. Better. A little better. The touch of cool metal
soothes him. Poor crazy Buckmaster has drained the cup by now, no
doubt. And has gone off on wings of dream to see them put the crown
of thorns in place, hammer in the nails, ram home the spear. Crazy?
Buckmaster is a happy man. He has placed himself beyond all pain. He
has outsmarted the minions of Genghis Mao. He has emerged out of his
torment into holiness, and he will walk daily with the apostles and
the Savior. To Buckmaster, the Palestine of Jesus is more real than
the Mongolia of Genghis Mao, and who can quarrel with that? Shadrach
might make the same choice, if he could. Of course, reality will
eventually intrude on Buckmaster's fantasy: a time will come, and
come soon, when Buckmaster's most recent Antidote treatment will
cease to be effective, and he is not likely to be able to obtain a
booster dose. But plainly he does not worry about that.</P>
<P>Thinking of Buckmaster's newfound tranquility
allows Shadrach to find a glimmering of it himself. This time he
sustains it, voyaging inward to that clear bright place beyond the
reach of storms. Buckmaster disappears; Genghis Mao disappears;
Shadrach disappears. For hours he works peacefully at his bench,
wholly at one with his tools, his lumber. When he departs from the
chapel late in the day he is in a state near ecstasy.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>He reaches Ulan Bator an hour after nightfall. As
soon as he arrives he phones Katya Lindman. &quot;I want to see you,&quot;
he says. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I was hoping you'd call. I knew you were
back.&quot; 
</P>
<P>They meet in a recreation lounge on the fiftieth
floor, a rendezvous favored by middle-echelon staffers. Service is
discreet there. The room is a dazzling high-vaulted oval, decorated
with shining golden metallic streamers only a few molecules thick
that dangle from the ceiling and twirl gently in the currents of air.
A giant portrait of Genghis Mao occupies the entice east wall of the
lounge, and there is one of Mangu at the other end.</P>
<P>Katya is wearing what is, for Katya, an unusually
slinky costume, a clinging tight-woven wrap of some soft rust-colored
fabric, low-cut to display her strong broad shoulders and her heavy
breasts. She may even have used perfume. Shadrach has never seen her
make the slightest concession to conventional femininity, and he is
surprised and disappointed to see her opting for such unsubtle
seductiveness now. It is not at all in character for her, and not at
all necessary. But perhaps Katya is weary of staying in character,
hard eyes, sharp teeth, cruel mouth, cool efficient mind, brisk and
capable woman of science. She has already confessed her love for him;
perhaps now she wants to play at being the sort of woman for whom
love is a plausible event. Foolish of her, if that's her game: he
much prefers the Katya he knows. Or thinks he knows. Love is not a
costume party.</P>
<P>She says, &quot;I didn't think you'd ever come
back.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I never intended not to. I wasn't trying to
disappear. Only to get away for a while and think things out.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;And did you succeed?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I hope so. I'll know soon enough.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I won't ask.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No. Don't.&quot;</P>
<P>She smiles. &quot;I'm glad you're back. Except
that I worry about the danger you're in.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;If I'm not worrying, why should you?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I don't need to answer that.&quot; Her voice
is husky, almost stagy. She leans forward and says, &quot;I missed
you, Shadrach. It amazed me how much I missed you. You don't like me
to say things like that, do you? 
</P>
<P>&quot;What gives you that idea?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Your face. You look so uncomfortable. You
don't want to hear soft words from me. You don't think it's proper
for mean, tough Dr. Lindman to talk that way.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'm just not used to you that way. It's a
side of you that's unfamiliar to me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You probably don't even like the way I'm
dressed tonight. But I can be the other Katya again, if you want.
Wait. I'll go and change into my lab smock.&quot; She sounds almost
serious.</P>
<P>&quot;Stop it,&quot; he says. He takes her hand. 
&quot;You look lovely tonight.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Thank you.&quot; Her voice is steely. She
withdraws the hand.</P>
<P>&quot;Well, you do. And I'm supposed to say so,
and I did; that's how the game is played. Now you're supposed to
say<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">&mdash;</FONT>&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Let's not play any more games, Shadrach,
Okay?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Okay. Did you dress like that for me or for
you?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;For both of us.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah. Just for the hell of it, right? Because
you just felt like coming on sexy. Right?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Right,&quot; she says. &quot;Okay?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Okay. Okay.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Is it okay to tell you that I missed you?
Don't force me to be some kind of machine, Shadrach. Don't make me be
whatever your image of me is. I'm not asking you to tell me you
missed me. But give me the right to express what <I>I</I> feel. Give
me the right to be silly once in a while, to be soft, to be
inconsistent, if I want to be. Without worrying about which one the
real Katya is. I'm always the real Katya, whoever I am at the moment.
Okay?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Okay,&quot; he says, and takes her hand
again, and she does not pull it away. After a moment he says, &quot;What's
been happening here while I was gone?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You know about the Khan's headaches, I
assume.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Sure. That's why I came back when I did. The
moment I picked up the telemetering impulses from him, in Peking,&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;Is it something serious?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;We're going to have to operate,&quot; he
says. &quot;As soon as some special equipment I've ordered is ready.&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;Is brain surgery especially risky?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Not as risky as you might think. But the
Khan doesn't like the idea of it at all, lasers poking into his
skull, et cetera, et cetera. I've never seen him look so spooked
about an operation. But he'll be all right. What else has been going
on here?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;There was the funeral.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes. I know. I was in Jerusalem then, or
Istanbul. I saw some photographs later.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It was monstrous,&quot; Karya tells him. &quot;It
went on for days and days. God knows how much it must have cost.
Everything stopped, practically, while we had the speeches, the
parades, the brass bands, the planes flying in formation, all kinds
of rituals and celebrations. And Genghis Mao sitting in the middle of
the plaza drinking everything in.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;What a pity I missed it.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'm sure you were heartbroken.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes. Terribly.&quot; 
</P>
<P>They laugh. He is beginning to think he rather
likes the way she looks in that dress. 
</P>
<P>He says, &quot;What else? How's your project
going?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Very well. Seventeen kinesic traits are
equivalent now. We've made more progress in the past three weeks than
in the previous three months.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Good. I want to see that automaton of yours
finished fast. I want your project to be the first one ready to go.&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;Have you talked to Nikki since you've been
back?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;No,&quot; he says. &quot;Not yet.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I hear that Avatar's been moving fast too.
They say that they're practically done converting from Mangu's
parameters to&mdash;to those of the new donor. Weeks ahead of
schedule. It scares me, Shadrach.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;It shouldn't.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I can't help thinking&mdash;what if&mdash;if
they ever actually do&mdash;&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;They won't,&quot; he says. &quot;It's not
going to happen. I'm much too valuable to Genghis Mao as I am.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot; 'Redundancy is our main avenue of
survival,' remember. How many other doctors do you think he has
waiting? Complete with telemeter implants and everything?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;None.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Can you be sure?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Buckmaster would know if a duplicate set of
implants had ever been built. He never heard anything about that.&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;Buckmaster's dead, Shadrach.&quot;</P>
<P>He lets the point pass. &quot;I know that there's
no duplicate Shadrach Mordecai waiting somewhere to take over when I
go. I realize now how dependent Genghis Mao is on me, exclusively on
me, irreplaceable me. And I have a notion I'm going to be a lot less
redundable in the near future, a lot more indispensable. I'm not
worrying about Avatar, Katya.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I hope you know what you're doing.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;So do I,&quot; he says. He gestures toward
the lounge exit, just below the vast blank-eyed portrait of sad silly
Mangu. &quot;Let's go upstairs,&quot; he suggests, and she smiles and
nods.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Now it is the morning of the operation. Genghis
Mao lies face down upon the operating table, awake, fully conscious,
occasionally turning his head to stare sourly at the doctors
assembled about him&mdash;Shadrach, Warhaftig, and Warhaftig's
neurological consultant, an Israeli named Malin. There is no
mistaking the Khan's look: he is frightened. He is trying to cover
his fear with his usual swagger, but he is not succeeding. In ten
minutes the surgical lasers will be drilling into his skull, and the
prospect does not charm him. But for the headaches&mdash;whose
effects are visible now, as imperial grimaces and winces&mdash;none
of this would be happening.</P>
<P>The Chairman's head has been shaved. Without his
thick black mane he looks, strangely, much younger, more vigorous:
that sturdy knob of a skull, bare, speaks of the immense strength of
the man, the intensity of the driving forces within him. The
musculature of his scalp is powerful and conspicuous, hills and
valleys outlined in bold relief, a rugged landscape of cords and
ridges nurtured and developed through nearly ninety years of
ferocious talking, thinking, biting, chewing. The surgeons' angles of
entry have been marked on his skin in luminous ink.</P>
<P>Warhaftig is ready to make the first incision. The
strategy of the operation has evolved during three days of
conferences. They will not go near the cerebral centers. The skull is
to be opened high on the occipital curve, and the drainage device is
to be inserted in the brain stem, the pons, just below the fourth
ventricle near the medulla oblongata. This, everyone has agreed, is
the optimum site for the valve, and not incidentally will keep the
lasers away from the seat of reason&mdash;though any surgical slip
could do damage to the medulla, which controls vasomotor and cardiac
functions and other vital autonomic responses. But Warhaftig is not
one who slips. 
</P>
<P>The surgeon glances at Shadrach. &quot;Is all
well?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Fine. Go when ready.&quot;</P>
<P>Warhaftig lightly touches Genghis Mao's neck. The
Khan does not react, nor does a sharp pinch at the base of his skull
bring any response from him. He is under local anesthesia, induced as
customary through sonipuncture. &quot;Now,&quot; Warhaftig says. &quot;We
begin.&quot; He makes the initial cut.</P>
<P>Genghis Mao closes his eyes&mdash;but, Shadrach's
inner monitors tell him, the Khan is still at full awareness, tense,
poised like a wary leopard on a high branch. The skin is peeled back
and clamped by retractors. Warhaftig steps aside and allows Malin to
make the cranial incision. The neurosurgeon's touch is not as deft as
Warhaftig's, but Malin has spent thirty years slicing into skulls,
and he knows as Warhaftig cannot possibly know just how much margin
for error his cuts can have. There, now: there is a window into the
Khan's head. Shadrach, peering on tiptoes, stares in awe at the very
brain that conceived the theories of centripetal depolarization, that
hatched the Permanent Revolutionary Committee, that carried mankind
out of the chaos of fhe Virus War. There, there, right there, in that
mysterious gray lump, it all was spawned, yes.</P>
<P>They are searching now for a site for the drainage
valve. Warhaftig has resumed command. Instead of a laser, he uses at
this point a hollow needle filled with liquid nitrogen,
cryostatically cooled to a temperature of -160&deg; C. The needle,
sliding to the depths of the Khan's brain stem, freezes the brain
cells on contact, and if contact is prolonged it will kill them.
While Malin calls off instrument readings and Shadrach supplies
telemetering data on the state of Genghis Mao's autonomic activities,
Warhaftig, reassured that he is not destroying vital neural centers,
opens a space for insertion of the drainage device. Everything goes
smoothly. The Khan continues to breathe, to pump blood, to generate
the normal array of electroencephalographic waves. There is lodged
within him now a tube to shunt excess cerebrospinal fluid into his
circulatory system, a valve through which the fluid can be drawn, and
a telemetering implant that will relay to his physician constant
reports on the functioning of that valve and the fluid levels of his
cranial ventricles. Bone and skin are restored to place; the Khan,
haggard and pallid but smiling now, is wheeled to the recovery
station.</P>
<P>Warhaftig turns to Shadrach. &quot;As long as we
have everything set up, let's proceed to the next operation
immediately. Yes?&quot; He reaches for Shadrach's left hand. &quot;You
want the telemetering implant to go here, is that correct? Embedded
in the thenar muscles. But not at the base of the thumb, eh? Over
here, closer to the center of the palm, do I have it? All right,
Let's scrub you up and get along with it, then.&quot;</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Shadrach and Nikki, meeting for the first time
since his return, are ill at ease with each other. He tries to smile,
but he doubts that his face is doing a very good job of it, and her
cordiality seems equally forced.</P>
<P>&quot;How is the Khan?&quot; she asks finally. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Healing,&quot; Shadrach says. &quot;As per
usual.&quot; 
</P>
<P>She glances at his bandaged left hand. &quot;And
you?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;A little sore. This implant was larger than
the others. More complex. Another day or two and I'll be fine.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'm glad everything went well.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes. Thank you.&quot;</P>
<P>They go through the ritual of forced smiles again.
&quot;It's good to see you,&quot; he says. &quot;Yes. Very good to
see you.&quot;</P>
<P>They are silent. But though the conversation has
faltered, neither begins to depart. He is surprised how unmoved he is
by her beauty today: she is as splendid as ever, but he feels
nothing, nothing at all, only a kind of abstract admiration, as he
might feel for a marble statue or a spectacular sunset. He tests it.
He summons memories. The coolness of her thighs against his lips. The
solidity of her breasts cupped in his hands. The little grunt as he
thrusts himself into her. The fragrance of her dark torrent of hair.
Nothing. The all-night conversations, when there was so much to tell
each other. Nothing. Nothing. Thus does treason carbonize love. But
she is still beautiful. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Shadrach&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>He waits. She is groping for words. He suspects he
knows what she wants to say: to tell him once more that she is sorry,
that she had no choice, that although she betrayed him it was only
out of a sense of the inevitability of what would befall. It is an
endless awkward moment.</P>
<P>At last she says, &quot;We're doing well on the
project.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;So I've been told.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I have to go on with it, you know. There's
no other way for me. But I want you to realize that I hope it never
is used. I mean, it's valuable research, it's a tremendous
breakthrough, but I want it to remain just a laboratory achievement,
just a&mdash;a&mdash;&quot; She falters.</P>
<P>&quot;That's all right,&quot; he tells her, and
hears an odd tenderness creeping into his voice. &quot;Don't torment
yourself about it, Nikki. Do your work, do it well. That's all you
need to think about. Do your work.&quot; For an instant, only an
instant, he feels a flicker of what he once felt for her. &quot;Don't
worry about me,&quot; he says gently. &quot;I'm going to be all
right.&quot;</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>On the third day the bandage comes off his hand.
There is only a faint pink line to mark the place where the implant
was inserted, a barely perceptible furrow against the darker pink of
his palm. Like his master, Shadrach is a swift healer. He flexes his
hand&mdash;slight muscular soreness, he notes&mdash;but is careful
not to clench it into a fist. He is not ready to test the new device.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>At the end of the week, with Genghis Mao rapidly
mending, Shadrach allows himself an evening in Karakorum. He goes
alone, on a mild summer night with the scent of new blossoms and the
hint of rain in the air, and hires a cubicle in the dream-death
pavilion, strips and dons the loincloth and the chest bands, takes
the polished talisman from the lioness-headed guide, looks upon the
pattern of spiraling lines, disappears into the hallucination. Once
more he dies. He gives up hope and fear and striving and dismay and
anxiety and need, he gives up breath and life, he dies to the world
and is reborn in another place, rising above his hollow outworn husk,
looking down upon it, that long brown empty form with its spidery
sprawl of limbs hanging out uselessly, and floats out, out into the
fragrant void, where time and space are cut loose from their
moorings. Everything is accessible to him, for he is dead. He enters
a city of ox carts and aileyways and low wooden buildings strung out
in rambling impenetrable mazes, a place of picturesque squalor and
medieval filth, and sees the lords and ladies in their green and
scarlet brocaded robes tumbling in the unpaved streets, howling,
sobbing, trembling, sweating, crying to the Lord, clutching at the
throbbing swollen places under their arms and between their legs.
Yes, yes, the Black Death, and Shadrach goes among them saying, I am
Shadrach the healer, come from the land of the dead to save you, and
he touches their fiery swellings and lifts them to their feet and
sends them forth into life, and they sing hymns to his name. And he
moves on to another city, a place of bamboo and silk, of gardens rich
with chrysanthemums and junipers and small contorted pines, and in
the stillness of the day a fireball bursts in the sky, a great
mushroom cloud bellies toward the roof of heaven, houses break into
flame, the people rush into the blazing streets, small folk,
almond-eyed, yellow-skinned, and Shadrach, standing like an ebony
tower among them, tells them in soft tones not to be afraid, that it
is only a dream that afflicts them, that pain and even death may yet
be rejected, and he spreads forth his hands to them, soothing them,
draining the fire from them. The sky fills with ash and soot and
pumice and it is the night of Cotopaxi once more, the volcano rumbles
and hisses and drones, the air turns to poison, and the young black
doctor kneels in the streets, breathing in the mouths of the fallen,
raising them, comforting them. And he moves on. The howling Assyrian
hordes ride through the streets of Jerusalem, slashing without mercy,
and Shadrach patiently sews together the sundered bodies of the
fallen, saying. Rise, walk, I am the Healer. The great woolly beasts
flee as the glacial snows melt beneath the suddenly colossal sun, and
the people of the caves grow thin and feeble, and Shadrach teaches
them to eat grasses and seeds, to collect the berries of the newly
sprouted thickets, to string weirs across the streams to snare the
frisky fishes, and they worship him and paint his image on the walls
of the holy cave. He takes Jesus from the cross when the Roman
soldiers go off to the tavern, slinging the limp body over one
shoulder and hurrying into a dark hut, where he wipes the blood from
the maimed hands and feet, he applies ointments and unguents, he
mixes a healing draft of herbs and juices and gives it to Him to
drink, telling Him, Go. Walk. Live. Preach. He seines the fragments
of Osiris from the Nile, he rejoins the severed members, he breathes
life into the fallen god and summons Isis, saying, Here is Osiris. I,
Shadrach, restore him to you. The sky grows green with strange
cloudbursts, and the Virus War breaks above the cities of mankind,
and the alien rot enters the bodies of mankind, and as the people
groan and fall. Shadrach raises them, saying, Fear nothing. Death is
transient. Life awaits you. And in the heavens is the smiling face of
Genghis Mao. Shadrach drifts across the centuries, moving freely in
space and time, and gradually he becomes aware that he is no longer
alone, that there is a woman beside him, plucking at his sleeve,
trying to tell him something. He ignores her. He hears celestial
choirs singing his name: &quot;Shadrach! Shadrach!&quot; And the
heavenly voices cry, &quot;O Shadrach! You are the true healer, you
are the prince of princes! Shadrach who was, Genghis to be! All hail
Shadrach!&quot; And a voice like thunder cries out, &quot;You
henceforth shall be known as Genghis III Mao V Khan!&quot;</P>
<P>And the woman plucks at his sleeve, and he sees
that she is Katya, and he says, &quot;What do you want?&quot; She
says, <I>It's too late. </I>He says, &quot;The next donor's already
been picked?&quot; <I>Yes. </I>&quot;I don't suppose you'd care to
tell me his name.&quot; <I>I don't think! should. </I>&quot;Who is
he?&quot; <I>You</I>, she says.The world erupts in flame and flood.
The laughter of Genghis Mao rolls through the heavens, shattering
mountains. Shadrach awakens. He sits up. He clenches his fist and
holds it tightly clenched. Out of Ulan Bator, four hundred kilometers
to the east, comes the terrible jolt of Genghis Mao's agony, the
silent scream of the sensors reporiing the wave of pain that is
sweeping through the Khan.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Shadrach approaches Interface Three and announces,
&quot;Shadrach Mordecai to serve the Khan.&quot;</P>
<P>He is scanned. He is approved. He is admitted.</P>
<P>It is close to midnight. Shadrach goes at once to
the Khan's bedroom, but Genghis Mao is not there. Shadrach frowns.
The Khan has been strong enough to leave his bed for the past several
days, but it is odd that he should be wandering around this late at
night. Shadrach finds a servitor who tells him that the Khan has
spent most of the evening in the secluded study known as the Khan's
Retreat, on the far side of the seventy-five-story compound, and is
probably there now.</P>
<P>Onward, then. Into the Khan's office&mdash;he is
not there&mdash;and thence to the private imperial dining room,
empty, and then Shadrach goes into his own office, where he pauses a
moment, collecting himself amid his familiar and beloved possessions,
his sphygmomanometers and scalpels, his microtomes and trephines.
Here, in a flask, is the authentic abdominal aorta of Genghis II Mao
IV Khan. Surely a treasure of medical history, that one. And here,
the newest addition to Shadrach's museum, is a lock of Genghis Mao's
thick, rank, preternaturally dark hair, an exhibit perhaps more
fitting for a museum of witchcraft and voodoo than one of medicine,
but yet appropriate, for it was removed in the course of preparations
for brain surgery carried out successfully in the celebrated
patient's ninetieth (or eighty-fifth, or ninety-fifth, or whatever)
year of life. And so. Onward. He presents himself to the door of the
Khan's Retreat and asks entry.</P>
<P>The door rolls back.</P>
<P>The Khan's Retreat is the room least used on the
floor, accessible only through Shadrach's office and insulated
against the intrusion of even the loudest external distractions. Its
ceiling is low, its lights are dim, its furnishings are ornate and
oriental, running toward thick draperies and elaborate carpets.
Genghis Mao lies on a cushioned divan along the left-hand wall.
Already his shaven scalp is coveted by a thin black stubble. The
vitality of the man is irrepressible. But he looks shaken, even
dazed.</P>
<P>&quot;Shadrach,&quot; he says. His voice is thick
and scratchy. &quot;I knew you'd get here. You felt it, didn't you?
About an hour and a half ago. I thought my head was going to
explode.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I felt it, yes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You told me you were putting a valve in me.
To drain off the fluid, you said.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;We did, sir.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Doesn't it work right?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It works perfectly, sir,&quot; Shadrach says
mildly.</P>
<P>Genghis Mao looks confused. &quot;Then what made
my head hurt so much a litlle while ago?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;This did,&quot; says Shadrach. He smiles and
stretches forth his left hand and clenches his fist.</P>
<P>For a moment nothing happens. Then Genghis Mao's
eyes widen in shock and amazement. He growls and clamps his hands to
his temples. He bites his lip, he bows his naked head, he drives his
knuckles against his eyes, he mutters anguished guttural curses. The
implanted sensors that report on the bodily functions of the Khan
tell Shadrach of the intense reactions within Genghis Mao: pulse and
respiration rates climbing alarmingly, blood pressure dropping,
intracranial pressure severe. Genghis Mao coils into a huddled ball,
shivering, groaning. Shadrach lets his fingers relax. Gradually the
pain recedes from Genghis Mao, the tense crumpled body uncoils, and
Shadrach ceases to feel the broadcast of shock symptoms. Genghis Mao
looks up. He stares at Shadrach for a long moment.</P>
<P>&quot;What have you done to me?&quot; Genghis Mao
asks in a harsh whisper.</P>
<P>&quot;Installed a valve in your skull, sir. To
drain away the dangerous accumulations of cerebrospinal fluid.
However, I should tell you that the action of the valve has been
designed to be reversible. Upon telemetered command it can be made to
pump fluid <I>into </I>the cranial ventricles instead of draining it
from them. I control the action of the valve, here, by a
piezoelectric crystal implanted in my palm. A twitch of my hand and
the fluid ceases to drain. A harder twitch and I can pump it upward.
I can interrupt your life processes. I can cause you instant pain of
the kind you have now experienced twice, and in a surprisingly short
span of time I could cause your death.&quot;</P>
<P>Genghis Mao's facial expression is entirely
opaque. He considers Shadrach's declaration in silence.</P>
<P>Eventually he says, &quot;Why have you done this
to me, Shadrach?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;To protect myself, sir.&quot;</P>
<P>The Khan manages a glacial smile. &quot;You
thought I would use your body for Project Avatar?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I was certain of it, sir.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Wrong. It wouldn't ever have happened.
You're too important for me as you are, Shadrach.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You think I'm lying. I tell you that there
was never any possibility we would have activated Project Avatar with
you as the donor. Don't misunderstand me, Shadrach. I'm not pleading
with you now. I'm simply telling you how things really stand.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, sir. But I know your teachings
concerning redundancy, sir. I feared I was about to be made
dispensable, I have made myself indispensable now, I think.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Would you kill me?&quot; Genghis Mao asks.  
</P>
<P>&quot;If I felt my life was in danger, yes.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;What would Hippocrates say about that?&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;The right of self defense is allowed even to
physicians, sir.&quot;</P>
<P>Genghis Mao's smile grows warmer. He seems to be
enjoying this discussion. There is no trace of anger on his face.</P>
<P>He says calmly, merely raising a speculative
hypothesis, &quot;Suppose I have you seized by stealth, immobilized
before you can clench your fist, and put to death?&quot;</P>
<P>Shadrach shakes his head, &quot;The implant in my
hand is keyed to the electrical output of my brain. If I die, if I'm
mindpicked in any way, if there's any sort of significant
interruption in my brain waves, the valve automatically begins
pumping cerebro-spinal fluid to your medulla. The moment of my death
is the automatic prelude to your own, sir. Our fates are joined.
Guard my life, sir, for your own sake.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And if I have the valve removed from my head
and replaced by one that isn't quite as&mdash;ah&mdash;versatile?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, sir. There's no way you could enter
surgery without my implant system notifying me of it. I'd take
defensive action, naturally, at the first moment. No. We have become
one entity in two bodies, sir. And we'll remain that way forever.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Very clever. Who built this mechanical
marvel for you?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Buckmaster did, sir.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Buckmaster? But he's been dead since May.
You couldn't have known then&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Buckmaster is still alive, sir,&quot;
Shadrach says softly. 
</P>
<P>Genghis Mao considers that. He grows extremely
thoughtful. He is silent for a long while. &quot;Still alive.
Strange.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I don't understand. &quot; Shadrach makes no
reply. After a time Genghis Mao says, &quot;You've planted a bomb in
me.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&quot;So to speak, sir, I have.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I have power over all of mankind. And you
have power over me, Shadrach. Do you realize what that makes you? You
are the true Khan now! All hail, Genghis III Mao V!&quot; Genghis Mao
laughs savagely. &quot;Do you understand that? Do you know what you
have achieved?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The thought has crossed my mind,&quot;
Shadrach admits.</P>
<P>&quot;You could force my resignation. You could
compel me to name you as my successor. You could kill me and assume
the Chairmanship, perfectly legitimately. You see that? Of course you
see that. Is that what you mean to do?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, sir. The last thing in the world I want
is to be Chairman.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Go ahead. Wiggle your hand at me, stage a
coup d'etat. Take power, Shadrach. I'm old, tired, bored, crumbling.
I'm willing to be overthrown. I admire your shrewdness. I'm
fascinated by what you've done. No one has ever fooled me so
thoroughly before, do you know that? You've accomplished what
thousands of enemies have utterly failed to do. Quiet Shadrach, loyal
Shadrach, dependable Shadrach&mdash;you have me beaten. You own me. I
am your puppet now, do you see that? Go on. Make yourself Chairman.
You've earned it, Shadrach.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It's not what I want.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What do you want, then?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;To continue as your physician. To protect
your health and strive to extend your life. To remain by your side
and serve you according to my oath.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That's <I>all?</I>&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That's all. No, there's one thing more,
sir.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Let's hear it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I request a place on the Committee, sir.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Specifically, I want authority in the sphere
of public health. Government medical policy.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah. Yes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Control over distribution of the Antidote,
sir. I mean to develop a program for immediate worldwide treatment of
the healthy population,&quot; Shadrach says. &quot;And expansion of
whatever programs currently exist for research into a permanent cure
for the organ-rot. That is, a total reversal of what I undersiand is
existing PRC policy.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah!&quot; Genghis Mao begins to laugh. &quot;Now
it emerges! You <I>do </I>intend to be Khan, then! I keep the
Chairmanship, but you call the tunes. Is that it, Shadrach? Is that
what you've engineered? Very well. You have me. I'm yours, Shadrach.
You'll join the Committee at the next meeting. Draw up your policy
statements and submit them.&quot; He glances somberly at Shadrach's
left hand. &quot;All hail,&quot; the Chairman cries, &quot;Genghis
III Mao V!&quot;</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>When he leaves the Khan's Retreat, Shadrach's
route back to his own suite takes him through his office, through
Committee Vector One, and into Surveillance Vector One, where he
halts awhile, as is his habit, to watch the show on the winking
screens. All is quiet in the Grand Tower of the Khan. It is the depth
of night; all Asia sleeps. But across the planet, out there in the
Trauma Ward, life goes on, and also death. Shadrach stands before the
multitude of screens, following the random flow, the suffering, the
striving, the struggling, the dying. The walking dead, wandering the
streets of Nairobi, Jerusalem, Istanbul, Rome, San Francisco, Peking,
shambling across all the continents, the procession of the damned,
the lost, the tortured, the condemned. Somewhere out there is Bhisma
Das. Somewhere, Meshach Yakov. Somewhere, Jim Ehrenreich. Shadrach
wishes them joy and good health for such of life as is left to them.
To all, joy! To all, good health!</P>
<P>He thinks of the laughter of Genghis Mao. How
amused the Khan seemed at his predicament! How relieved, almost, at
having the ultimate authority stolen from him! But the Khan is beyond
comprehension; the Khan is alien, mysterious, unfathomable,
ultimately inscrutable. Shadrach does not really know what will
happen now. He cannot imagine what counterploy Genghis Mao may
already have conceived, what traps he is even now devising. Shadrach
will walk warily and hope for the best. He has planted a bomb in
Genghis Mao, yes, but he has also seized a tiger by the tail, and he
must be careful lest he stumble between the metaphors and be
destroyed.</P>
<P>He stands mesmerized before the dazzling dance of
the screens of Surveillance Vector One. It is the fourth of July,
2012. Wednesday. Gentle rain is falling in Ulan Bator, which next
week shall be renamed Altan Mangu in honor of the slain viceroy, who
already has been forgotten by most of mankind. In this night death
will travel the globe, harvesting his thousands; but in the morning,
Shadrach Mordecai vows, things will begin to change. He stretches
forth his left hand. He studies it as though it be a thing of
precious jade, of rarest ivory. Tentatively he closes it, almost but
not quite clenching his fist. He smiles. He touches the tips of his
fingers to his lips and blows a kiss to all the world.</P>
